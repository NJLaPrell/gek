Millions of dollars are lost to these scammers and the police in Kolkata do very little to shut down these call centers, so it would be great if people shared these videos and tweeted @KolkataPolice\n\nLet's hope we can make a \"shut down\" video before long.

It's been adopted by people who don't seem to hold the responsibility side of it and don't seem to hold the compassion side of it.\"\n\nFor decades, Penn‚Äîthe larger, louder half of the performing duo Penn & Teller‚Äîhas been among the best-known spokesmen for libertarian ideas and attitudes in politics and culture. But he says that the 2016 election of Donald Trump‚Äîwhom he knows well and loathes from his days on The Celebrity Apprentice‚Äîand the COVID pandemic have forced him to rethink whether he wants to continue to be publicly associated with the broader libertarian movement.\n\n\"I can see arguments for not wearing seatbelts and I can see arguments for not wearing motorcycle helmets,\" he told Big Think two years ago. \"But I cannot see any argument for driving drunk and that is what not wearing a mask is. It's not risking yourself, it's risking the people around you.\"\n\nFor many Americans, though, trillions in wasted spending, contradictory guidance from public health officials, arbitrary school and business shutdowns, and policies like closing beaches and outdoor dining have made them more skeptical of government power and expertise.\n\nSo why did the 2016 election and the pandemic cause one of the libertarian movement's most important public figures to go in the other direction?\n\nHas libertarianism changed‚Äîor has Penn?\n\nReason's Nick Gillespie caught up with him in Las Vegas on the set of his popular podcast Penn's Sunday School to talk about Trump, COVID restrictions, and whether his view of the world has really changed. Also joining the conversation was Matt Donnelly, the cohost of Penn's Sunday School.\n\nProduced by Nick Gillespie; camera by James Marsh and Noor Greene; edited by Brett Raney and Adam Czarnecki.\n\nPhotos credits: Newscom/Penn Jillette/evphotostwo288423; Newscom/Penn & Teller 2012/zumaamericasseven518137; Newscom/Penn Jillette/ptsphotoshotthree271167; Flickr/Donald Trump speaking with supporters at a campaign rally at the Phoenix Convention Center in Phoenix, Arizona/Gage Skidmore; Unsplash/mother and daughter wearing pollution protection masks in taxi/Jon Tyson; Newscom/Penn Jillette-All-Star, Celebrity Apprentice/spnphotosfour433360; Unsplash/David Veksler - https://unsplash.com/photos/0UF_vme6lJ8; Newscom/Penn Jillette/krtphotoslive271616; Image via screengrab/Penn Jillette Responds to Donald Trump's Tweets on Opie with Jim Norton [07-16-2015]; Google Search/Joe Biden/Biden Signs Covid-19 Relief Bill; Newscom/Anthony Fauci/dpaphotosfive795473; Google Search/Education Week/Closed due to Covid-19; Google Search/Beaches close down as Covid-19 lockdown continues; Newscom/President Biden listens to a speaker during a virtual meeting/sipaphotosfourteen130929; Google Search/Young boy receives Pfizer vaccine in Venezuela; Newscom/Penn Jillette on stage in 2017/polspphotos407638; Google Search/Penn Jillette in Vegas before his show; Unsplash/International daily newspaper from Thursday 5th November 2020 ‚Äì Le Monde (France) & The New York Times (USA) ‚Äì After the election report.

A woman apparently told responding officers that her son, 29-year-old Tyler Patrick, was acting delusional and banging on the house. Officers spoke with Patrick inside the residence and determined that he should be taken to a local hospital. As one officer, later identified as Off. George Kloos, tried to walk Patrick out of the residence, he swung a concealed [pocket] knife at the officer and stabbed Kloos in the neck. \n\nPatrick then attempted to stab two other officers as they tackled him onto a couch. Officers ‚Äúwrestled‚Äù the knife out of his hand and took him into custody. Patrick was taken to the hospital for minor injuries he suffered during his arrest. He was treated, released and booked in the Montgomery County Jail. Patrick is facing three counts of felonious assault of a peace officer. Patrick appeared in court Friday afternoon where his bond was set at $500,000. He‚Äôs set to appear in court next on October 24, 2022. Officer Kloos, 10-year veteran of the force, was taken to Miami Valley Hospital and was released later that day. Doctors said the knife somehow missed the arteries in his neck. He is now home, and expected to make a full recovery.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nSpecial thanks to Shout-Out Supporters on Patreon:\n- Gianni M.\n- Charles Cooper\n- Joe\n- Cooper Malley\n- Luis Perez\n- Chris Wesley\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UZ-jkQs3EvQ/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UCXMYxKMh3prxnM_4kYZuB3g","channelTitle":"PoliceActivity","duration":"PT14M16S","viewCount":"530833","likeCount":"16481","commentCount":"5030","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDyK2zVsJSyquSdp7IVNEDTH","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REeUsyelZzSlN5cXVTZHA3SVZORURUSC41NkI0NEY2RDEwNTU3Q0M2","playlistPosition":0},{"videoId":"f6263LFJfuc","publishedAt":"2022-10-17T13:00:22Z","title":"When Not Showing Your Receipt Goes HORRIBLY Wrong","description":"Second Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClTjur-9cx8Bb4MW8r0K6xw\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/audittheaudit\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AuditTheAudit\n\nSubmit your videos here: auditheaudit@gmail.com\n\nSponsorship inquiries: audit@ellify.com\n\nWelcome to Audit the Audit, where we sort out the who and what and the right and wrong of police interactions.

During the stop, Officer Lau learned Garcia had an extraditable warrant from Texas and took her into custody. After Gladstone Sgt. Travis Hill arrived to the scene, Garcia told officers she was concerned about her two pit bulls alone at her home. Officers agreed to stop at her home on the way to jail to secure her dogs for Clackamas County Dog Control. The officers arrived at the home with Garcia. She was in handcuffs at the time. They enter the home through the garage and the dogs rushed out. The dogs barked at the officers, one growling. Garcia recommends getting leashes for her pets. With her hands behind her back and in handcuffs, Garcia walked upstairs to get a leash. Garcia drew Sgt. Hill‚Äôs attention away from her for a moment and was able to grab a 9mm semi-automatic handgun from a nearby nightstand. \n\nGarcia said she would not go back to jail and then shot Sgt. Hill in the lower leg. The two officers then exchanged gunfire with Garcia, yelling at her multiple times to drop the gun. Moments later, backup arrives, and Officer Lau rushed in to help his partner. Garcia was hit in the torso multiples times and taken to the hospital for treatment. Officer Lau was not injured, but Sgt. Hill was shot in the leg and grazed on the arm. Hill‚Äôs leg wound caused permanent injury and he left law enforcement. On. October 12, 2022, Clackamas County Circuit Judge Cody M. Weston sentenced Garcia to 10 years in prison, the maximum sentence allowed for attempted aggravated murder under Oregon law. She is also required to pay Hill a $50,000 compensatory fine for injuries that caused permanent injury. Texas officials intent to extradite Garcia for allegedly embezzling $1.4 million from an oil company where she worked in Ector County.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nSpecial thanks to Shout-Out Supporters on Patreon:\n- Gianni M.\n- Charles Cooper\n- Joe\n- Cooper Malley\n- Luis Perez\n- Chris Wesley\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LAQCc07kZbo/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UCXMYxKMh3prxnM_4kYZuB3g","channelTitle":"PoliceActivity","duration":"PT10M23S","viewCount":"863806","likeCount":"32540","commentCount":"9747","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDyK2zVsJSyquSdp7IVNEDTH","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REeUsyelZzSlN5cXVTZHA3SVZORURUSC4wMTcyMDhGQUE4NTIzM0Y5","playlistPosition":2},{"videoId":"wgUqkqtKdeI","publishedAt":"2022-10-11T16:00:40Z","title":"Suspect Gets Shot by Deputies After Pointing a Flashlight","description":"* (Disclaimer: This video content is intended for educational and informational purposes only) *\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico ‚Äî On September 20, 2022, at approximately 1:23 pm, Bernalillo County Sheriff's Deputies were flagged down at 201 Rio Bravo Blvd SW in reference to a suspicious person inside a vehicle.

Multiple witnesses of the deputy-involved shooting were interviewed and stated they observed the suspect pointing what was perceived to be a firearm. The object was later determined to be a black flashlight recovered from the scene. Fentanyl, heroin, and drug paraphernalia were located in the vehicle, along with dozens of bank cards with various identities. The suspect has been identified as 45-year-old, Colby Atkins. Atkins has an extensive criminal history. In 2020, Atkins was released from federal prison. At the time of the shooting, Atkins was in a stolen vehicle and had multiple active arrest warrants.\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wgUqkqtKdeI/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UCXMYxKMh3prxnM_4kYZuB3g","channelTitle":"PoliceActivity","duration":"PT2M41S","viewCount":"409865","likeCount":"14390","commentCount":"2553","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDyK2zVsJSyquSdp7IVNEDTH","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REeUsyelZzSlN5cXVTZHA3SVZORURUSC41MjE1MkI0OTQ2QzJGNzNG","playlistPosition":3},{"videoId":"AGm63POHQzo","publishedAt":"2022-06-06T16:15:00Z","title":"Houston Officer Shoots Man After He Charged Them With Pieces Of Glass in His Hands","description":"* (Disclaimer: This video content is intended for educational and informational purposes only) *\nHouston, Texas ‚Äî Charges have been filed against a suspect shot by a Houston police officer at 10630 Beechnut Street about 3:25 p.m. on Wednesday (May 11).

Niagara Falls police say it started as a domestic incident Friday. Officers arrived at 80th street and Niagara Falls Boulevard near the Rite Aid after someone called 911 saying a man was in the backyard of a woman he had sexually assaulted in the past that she had an order of protection against him. That‚Äôs where they found the 29-year-old suspect, Reginald Barnes. Officer Greg Paul approached Barnes to place him in custody, but he pulled away. \n\nHe fell to the ground and got up.

Seeing the stabbing attack, Officer Greg Paul and Lieutenant Joseph Scibilia shot Barnes. The video shows Barnes put his hands up as he is hit by the gunfire and he falls face forward on a patch of grass. Barnes‚Äô body then rolls to a stop at Paul‚Äôs feet. The suspect was given first aid at the scene and was transported to Erie County Medical Center. He remains in critical condition.

Deputies contacted the driver and ordered him out of the vehicle for further investigation. The driver became uncooperative, re-entered his vehicle, and sped away dragging a deputy a short distance. A vehicle pursuit ensued, ultimately concluding on a steep hillside in the 3600 block of Conning Street. \n\nDeputies exited their vehicles and attempted to call the suspect out of his vehicle. The suspect reversed his vehicle in rapid acceleration in the direction of the deputies, resulting in a deputy-involved shooting. The suspect, Jeovanni Ramirez, 31-year-old resident of Jurupa Valley, was not struck by gunfire. He was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon. The injured deputy was transported to a local hospital and received medical treatment for his injuries. The involved deputy was placed on paid administrative leave according to Department policy.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nSpecial thanks to Shout-Out Supporters on Patreon:\n- Gianni M.\n- Charles Cooper\n- Joe\n- Cooper Malley\n- Luis Perez\n- Chris Wesley\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mWmFnTowToc/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UCXMYxKMh3prxnM_4kYZuB3g","channelTitle":"PoliceActivity","duration":"PT2M10S","viewCount":"730740","likeCount":"18438","commentCount":"2611","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDyK2zVsJSyquSdp7IVNEDTH","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REeUsyelZzSlN5cXVTZHA3SVZORURUSC5ENDU4Q0M4RDExNzM1Mjcy","playlistPosition":18},{"videoId":"ViNfTpLowmc","publishedAt":"2022-10-19T20:09:57Z","title":"Officer Shoots Through Windshield in Gun Battle While Pursuing Suspects Armed With AK-47","description":"* (Disclaimer: This video content is intended for educational and informational purposes only) *\nEureka, California ‚Äî On July 20, 2022, at 7:20 p.m., a Humboldt County Sheriff‚Äôs Field Training Officer and a deputy sheriff one undergoing field training were on patrol in the area of Fairway Drive in Eureka when they observed a white 2003 Kia Sorrento driving recklessly at approximately 65 miles per hour. Deputies attempted a traffic stop on the Kia. The vehicle, driven by 27-year-old Darrike Miles McKeown, failed to yield and deputies initiated a pursuit. Investigators later learned that the Kia had been involved in a short pursuit with officers of the Eureka Police Department just prior to this incident. Deputies followed the Kia onto Vance Avenue from Herrick Avenue where the vehicle reached estimated speeds of up to 50 miles per hour. \n\nNear the intersection of Vance and Eureka Streets, the front passenger of the vehicle, 32-year-old Jared Eli Aubrey, exhibited a rifle and fired multiple shots out of the vehicle towards the pursuing deputies. Deputies did not return fire at this location. Investigators were later notified that a bullet consistent with the ammunition fired from the suspect‚Äôs weapon entered a nearby home. No one was injured as a result. Deputies continued to pursue the vehicle for approximately 1.7 miles, traveling through the Pine Hill community and into Eureka city limits. Near the intersection of Utah Street and Highland Avenue, Aubrey leaned out the window and pointed the rifle at the Deputies. The Humboldt County Sheriff‚Äôs Field Training Officer, utilizing a department issued rifle, fired four shots through his patrol vehicle‚Äôs windshield. \n\nThe pursuit then continued to Henderson Street, where McKeown began driving the wrong way, east on Henderson. The pursuit continued onto O Street and then onto Buhne Street with no further gunfire. At the intersection of Buhne Street and Harrison Avenue, the Kia struck a vehicle occupied by one civilian, and became disabled. Aubrey, McKeown and a third occupant of the Kia were detained at this location and ultimately, Aubrey and McKeown were arrested and booked into the Humboldt County Correctional Facility. The civilian and McKeown both sustained injuries as a result of the traffic collision. Further examination of the involved patrol vehicle revealed that the vehicle had been struck multiple times. Evidence obtained through this investigation indicate Aubrey fired from an AK-47 style assault rifle which was still in his possession upon being taken into custody.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nSpecial thanks to Shout-Out Supporters on Patreon:\n- Gianni M.\n- Charles Cooper\n- Joe\n- Cooper Malley\n- Luis Perez\n- Chris Wesley\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 - Bodycam Footage of OIS\n6:15 - Incident Briefing","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ViNfTpLowmc/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UCXMYxKMh3prxnM_4kYZuB3g","channelTitle":"PoliceActivity","duration":"PT8M4S","viewCount":"1181351","likeCount":"27468","commentCount":"4949","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDyK2zVsJSyquSdp7IVNEDTH","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REeUsyelZzSlN5cXVTZHA3SVZORURUSC4yMDhBMkNBNjRDMjQxQTg1","playlistPosition":19},{"videoId":"78i9KlWdaQo","publishedAt":"2022-10-20T20:19:00Z","title":"Most Frustrating Cops to Deal with!

Neal) believed to be in possession of a firearm. Neal had two guns in the car with him. One was underneath of him. Decatur police said, that is the one he reached for before opening fire on the officers, shooting and wounding two of the officers. One video shows Decatur Police Sgt. Timothy Wittmer's hair being ruffled by a passing bullet and the officer falling to the ground as he is hit multiple times. His semi-automatic service pistol jams as he lays on the rain-soaked pavement and he quickly clears it before opening fire and appearing to empty his magazine at Neal who collapses, his body twitching with bullet impacts. \n\nFour police officers had returned fire at Neal: three Decatur officers and Macon County Sheriff's Deputy Travis Wolfe. During the incident, officers returned fire, shooting Neal. Neal was struck multiple times. Neal later died at a local hospital. Sgt. Wittmer was shot multiple times during this incident. He was shot in the hand which required surgery. He was also shot in the foot and the left posterior area, but a titanium wallet stopped that bullet. He had fragment injuries on his head. Officer Bowman was shot one time in the lower abdomen during this incident. It was a \"through and through\" wound. Both Sgt. Wittmer and Ofc. Bowman have been released from the hospital and are recovering. They remain on leave while the fatal shooting is investigated by the Illinois State Police, which is standard procedure.  \n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nSpecial thanks to Shout-Out Supporters on Patreon:\n- Rob Winton\n- 'The Chocolate Thief'\n- 'Jacob from Wisconi'\n- 'gorey hole'\n- Gianni M.\n- Charles Cooper\n- Joe\n- Cooper Malley\n- Luis Perez\n- Chris Wesley\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 - Dashcam: Officer Austin Bowman\n1:22 - Bodycam: Sgt.

While on routine patrol, he observed a black Chevy Tahoe traveling southbound on United States Highway 65 with tags that expired in March of 2022. Trp. Morphis activated emergency equipment to conduct a traffic stop on the vehicle for the observed violation. Once emergency equipment was activated, the vehicle continued to travel southbound on United States Highway 65. Approximately one mile after activating the emergency equipment, the driver of the vehicle turned his right turn signal on, but continued to travel southbound at a speed of 61 mph. \n\nAfter approximately 1.5 miles, Trp. Morphis advised ASP-Troop F Dispatch that they were still continuing southbound. Trooper Tyler Grant was approximately two miles south of Trp. Morphis location on United States Highway 65 and responded to assist him. Pursuant to Arkansas State Police Policy (LE SEC 18), Trp. Grant took primary position of the pursuit in his marked ASP unit. They continued southbound on United States Highway 65 for approximately one more mile. Once in a safe location, Trp. Grant moved into position to perform a Precision Immobilization Technique (PIT). A PIT maneuver was successfully conducted, resulting in the vehicle exiting the roadway and traveling into the west roadside ditch. Once in the roadside ditch, the vehicle overturned two times, and came to final rest on its roof. \n\nThe driver, identified as John Jones and the passenger, identified as Justin Hurd, were both removed from the vehicle and taken into custody without further incident. Pafford EMS responded to the scene and examined both suspects. Both suspects refused medical treatment and were transported to the Lake Village Jail. Jones was charged with Felony Fleeing, Reckless Driving, No Liability Insurance, No Seatbelt, Driving on Suspended Driver's License, and Expired Registration. Jones also had a nationwide extradition warrant out of the Arkansas Board of Parole, and an additional warrant out of the Chicot County Sheriff's Office for commercial burglary. Jones is being held at the Lake Village Jail for a first appearance. Hurd was not charged by the Arkansas State Police. Hurd stated throughout the encounter that he was attempting to get out of the vehicle but that Jones would not stop to let him out.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nSpecial thanks to Shout-Out Supporters on Patreon:\n- Gianni M.\n- Charles Cooper\n- Joe\n- Cooper Malley\n- Luis Perez\n- Chris Wesley\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QJKiVuUOe4g/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UCXMYxKMh3prxnM_4kYZuB3g","channelTitle":"PoliceActivity","duration":"PT24M25S","viewCount":"453820","likeCount":"14364","commentCount":"2434","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDyK2zVsJSyquSdp7IVNEDTH","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REeUsyelZzSlN5cXVTZHA3SVZORURUSC5DMkU4NTY1QUFGQTYwMDE3","playlistPosition":27},{"videoId":"4HSu3TBEUP8","publishedAt":"2022-10-20T22:33:43Z","title":"Florida Highway Patrol Trooper Performs a Triple PIT Maneuver To Apprehend Felon in Orange County","description":"* (Disclaimer: This video content is intended for educational and informational purposes only) *\nOrange County, Florida ‚Äî On Wednesday, October 19, 2022, Brevard County deputies saw a white Kia, in a parking lot. When they ran a query on the plate, they discovered that the 33-year-old Daniel Harris had a felony warrant for terroristic threats. Before the deputy could remove Harris from the vehicle, he escaped. The Brevard County deputies started the pursuit around 2:05 pm. The Florida Highway Patrol received the call around 2:09 p.m. that Brevard deputies were pursuing Harris and  joined the pursuit a few minutes later as the white Kia Soul deputies were tailing drove between 55 and 75 mph down the Beachline around mile marker 26. Harris made no attempt to stop and continued switching lanes, despite troopers activating their emergency lights and sirens. \n\nMultiple FHP vehicles actively attempt to slow down the Kia by braking in front of it and repeatedly ramming into the vehicle. Sgt. Spencer Ross tried to slow Harris down by breaking in front of him before he needed to use a PIT, or precision immobilization technique, but footage shows the Kia regained control. Sgt. Ross initiated a second PIT maneuver and successfully disabled Harris‚Äô vehicle. Harris is then seen getting out of the vehicle with his hands up. Aerial footage shows a swarm of FHP cruisers surround Harris as the pursuit culminates in an arrest in Orange County. Harris was transported to the Orange County Jail, where he faces multiple charges, including for terroristic threats, fleeing and eluding a law enforcement officer and driving with a suspended license.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nSpecial thanks to Shout-Out Supporters on Patreon:\n- Gianni M.\n- Charles Cooper\n- Joe\n- Cooper Malley\n- Luis Perez\n- Chris Wesley\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4HSu3TBEUP8/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UCXMYxKMh3prxnM_4kYZuB3g","channelTitle":"PoliceActivity","duration":"PT2M26S","viewCount":"341564","likeCount":"12282","commentCount":"1135","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDyK2zVsJSyquSdp7IVNEDTH","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REeUsyelZzSlN5cXVTZHA3SVZORURUSC44Mjc5REFBRUE2MTdFRDU0","playlistPosition":28},{"videoId":"qB3n9anQ7GM","publishedAt":"2022-10-21T16:23:30Z","title":"Mesa Officer Shoots Suspect Who Drove Into Pizzeria To Avoid Police","description":"* (Disclaimer: This video content is intended for educational and informational purposes only) *\nMesa, Arizona ‚Äî On August 21, 2022, Mesa police officers were called to assist the Department of Public Safety with locating a wanted fugitive,  36-year-old Kevin McKinney out of Albuquerque, New Mexico. McKinney was wanted for a homicide that occurred in Albuquerque, on August 20, 2022. McKinney also had a probation violation warrant in Colorado. Albuquerque Police believe that McKinney was in Mesa, based off of cell phone records which showed him in the area of Dobson and Baseline roads. His vehicle was described as a black 2011 Jeep Patriot, equipped with multiple spotlights and red and blue lights inside to mimic a police car. Just after 3:30 PM detectives spotted McKinney's vehicle parked outside of a pizzeria on Dobson and Baseline Road. Detectives confirmed that McKinney was sitting inside a cell phone store next to the pizzeria. \n\nMcKinney left the wireless store and got into the driver's seat of his vehicle, that's what Mesa police officers positioned one of their vehicles at the back of McKinney's to contain him. Officers shouted for McKinney to exit the vehicle with his hands up. McKinney tried to back up into the police vehicle and that's when officers fired Les lethal beanbag rounds at his vehicle. McKinney quickly put his car in drive and drove forward, accelerating into the pizza restaurant. That is when multiple officers shot their Duty weapons. A surveillance video from inside the restaurant shows the vehicle breaking through the front door as three employees and one customer were inside. At the time, none of them were injured. McKinney stopped moving his vehicle and after a short time exited his vehicle. He was taken to the hospital and treated for gunshot wounds. Kevin McKinney faces multiple charges. A revolver and knives were recovered from McKinney's vehicle.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nSpecial thanks to Shout-Out Supporters on Patreon:\n- Rob Winton\n- 'The Chocolate Thief'\n- 'Jacob from Wisconi'\n- 'gorey hole'\n- Gianni M.\n- Charles Cooper\n- Joe\n- Cooper Malley\n- Luis Perez\n- Chris Wesley\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qB3n9anQ7GM/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UCXMYxKMh3prxnM_4kYZuB3g","channelTitle":"PoliceActivity","duration":"PT1M46S","viewCount":"551551","likeCount":"17083","commentCount":"3736","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDyK2zVsJSyquSdp7IVNEDTH","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REeUsyelZzSlN5cXVTZHA3SVZORURUSC43NDhFRTgwOTRERTU4Rjg3","playlistPosition":29},{"videoId":"vgCVHdFnj54","publishedAt":"2022-10-21T18:23:10Z","title":"Bodycam Video of Deputies Responding to and Shooting Man in Stolen Car","description":"* (Disclaimer: This video content is intended for educational and informational purposes only) *\nDenver, Colorado ‚Äî On March 3, 2022, while on patrol, Deputy Daniel Willmont with the Arapahoe County Sheriff‚Äôs Office received a citizen request to investigate a suspicious vehicle. Deputy Willmont learned the suspicious vehicle had been reported stolen and called for assistance. Once on scene, the deputies contacted the suspect, who was sitting in the driver‚Äôs seat of the stolen vehicle, a brown Kia Sportage SUV. The deputies announced themselves and attempted to obtain the suspect‚Äôs voluntary surrender, but the suspect failed to comply with the deputies‚Äô commands to show both of his hands. \n\nThe suspect then placed the stolen vehicle into reverse and hit the patrol vehicle where Deputy Willmont was positioned. As the stolen vehicle reversed, Deputy Foley deployed his taser through the driver‚Äôs side window and Deputy Willmont fired his agency-issued rifle through the rear window of the stolen vehicle. The suspect then placed the vehicle into drive. Once the vehicle came to a stop, the deputies removed the suspect, secured him and rendered emergency aid after determining he had suffered a single gunshot wound to the back. Deputies requested fire rescue and advanced life support resources but the suspect, 30-year-old Jamarian McGhee, was pronounced dead at the scene.

The subject used a radio device to speak and identify himself as Washington-37, Washington-21 and Washington-15, requesting \"radio checks\" and driver's license information regarding various subjects. The subject also set off \"alert\" tones on the Washington County Sheriff's Office dispatch radio frequency. The same subject later transmitted on Washington County EMS radio frequencies, identifying himself as \"EMS-3\" and \"Medic-121.\"\n\nAt one point, a police lieutenant sent a radio signal to the transmitting device, intending to shut down the unauthorized transmissions. A short time later, the Washington County Sheriff's Office Communications Center received a series of the same signals, which shut down the Washington County Sheriff's Office Communications Center radio for several hours.\n\nThe unknown subject made multiple attempts to continuously disable Washington County Sheriff's Office radios, and sent disabling signals to EMS radios which disabled EMS communications for 13 hours, and later, again, for about seven hours.\n\nA radio text message was subsequently received from the unknown subject advising, in essence, that he would leave the police alone, if they left him alone.\n\nIn January 2019, investigators with the Bay County Sheriff's Office, while working a similar series of radio transmissions and service interruptions, developed a lead, and on January 4, 2019, BCSO investigators arranged a meeting with Cody Blaine Jones under the guise that they wanted to give him a \"thank you\" card for his assistance to the Sheriff's Office. Jones was advised that he was being detained, and he attempted to run, however Jones was tackled to the ground and was taken into custody, after which he gave this statement. When Jones was captured, he was found to be in possession of a police badge and gun. Jones had previously been prosecuted for his participation in a \"swatting\" network, along with various drug charges, and was a convicted felon. After being transported to the Bay County Sheriff's Office, Jones gave this recorded statement, along with another, much longer, recorded statement.\n\nCody Blaine Jones was ultimately charged with disruption of a computer network, unauthorized reception of communication services, three counts of falsely personating a law enforcement officer, depriving a law enforcement officer of a means of communication, unauthorized transmission to government radio frequencies, three counts of unlawful use of a two-way communication device, and violation of probation. Jones was ultimately convicted on multiple counts and was sentenced to five years in state prison.\n\nJessica Ann Marie Davis was charged with accessory to a number of the charges against Jones, as well as perjury not in an official proceeding. All charges against Davis were eventually dropped, however Davis kept busy, and has since faced prosecution for driving without a license, driving a motorcycle without a motorcycle license, possession of paraphernalia, driving without insurance, failure to exhibit a driver's license, forgery (for attempting to pay for Taco Bell using a fake $100 bill), driving without a motorcycle endorsement (again), driving without a motorcycle endorsement (yet again), destruction of / tampering with evidence, and a probation violation.\n\n/r/realworldpolice\n@realworldpolice\n@What You Haven't Seen \n\n00:00 Police interview of Cody Blaine Jones\n23:01 Police interview of Jessica Ann Marie Davis\n32:19 Photos of radio equipment","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RKWdACh7lZY/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UChaEeYV0iibwFqrmFYTweVA","channelTitle":"Real World Police","duration":"PT33M40S","viewCount":"72386","likeCount":"1928","commentCount":"622","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDyK2zVsJSyquSdp7IVNEDTH","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REeUsyelZzSlN5cXVTZHA3SVZORURUSC5CMEQ2Mjk5NTc3NDZFRUNB","playlistPosition":32},{"videoId":"lM-tQJ-wTD0","publishedAt":"2022-10-25T20:20:44Z","title":"Traffic cop LIES to the WRONG woman","description":"The reputation of Victoria Police continues to take a hammering as angry citizens film interactions with officers to show their bullying tactics.\nFULL REPORT: https://rebelne.ws/3DqeiUu\nüö®DON'T MISS A THING: http://FollowAvi.com\n\n--------\n‚ù§Ô∏èüôè‚ù§Ô∏èSUPPORT MY WORK‚ù§Ô∏èüôè‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nRebel News: https://www.rebelnews.com/donate\nPersonally: https://aviyemini.com.au/support/\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/OzraeliAvi\nPayPal: https://paypal.me/aviyemini","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lM-tQJ-wTD0/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UCrOXPKiTSfjY-z7y0MeR05w","channelTitle":"Avi Yemini","duration":"PT8M50S","viewCount":"323148","likeCount":"18739","commentCount":"5893","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDyK2zVsJSyquSdp7IVNEDTH","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REeUsyelZzSlN5cXVTZHA3SVZORURUSC42MTI4Njc2QjM1RjU1MjlG","playlistPosition":33},{"videoId":"ns7iF_Gec8M","publishedAt":"2020-12-17T14:55:59Z","title":"Cops Arrest Journalist Investigating Food Hazards","description":"Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/audittheaudit\n\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/3fKIZF8\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AuditTheAudit\n\nAudit the Audit 2: http://bit.ly/2CD2b6j\n\nSubmit your videos here: auditheaudit@gmail.com\n\nSponsorship inquiries: audit@ellifyagency.com\n\nWelcome to Audit the Audit, where we sort out the who and what and the right and wrong of police interactions.

Deputy Courtney Hoyt‚Äôs body camera video shows Dylan De Reivera threatening to jump off the North Causeway Bridge. Hoyt spent several minutes talking to De Reivera before he jumped onto a lower platform and took off running. Deputy Hoyt said that‚Äôs when she spotted him taking something from his pocket. Investigators said it was a knife. Deputy Hoyt eventually caught up with De Reivera in her patrol car, and she had backup. \n\nDeputy Jorge Mendez, arrived to find De Reivera walking along the sidewalk and ordered him to the ground, which he ignored. De Reivera continued to ignore the commands while walking toward the deputy. Deputy Mendez backed away from De Reivera and fired his Taser at De Reivera. The first shock sent De Reivera to the ground. For the next 30 seconds, De Reivera struggled with deputies as they tried to put him in handcuffs. He removed the probes from the Taser, and during the struggle, he picked up the Taser that belonged to Deputy Mendez. Deputy Hoyt told her fellow deputy to back up and charge his Taser. De Reivera got back on his feet and ran in the general direction of motorists.\n\nDeputy Hoyt drew her firearm and shot De Reivera in the upper leg. The gunshot didn't stop De Reivera as he continued to run away from deputies but is quickly apprehended by other officers. He was arrested on charges including resisting officer with violence, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and battery on a law enforcement officer. The State Attorney‚Äôs investigation concluded that Hoyt thought she was firing her taser, not her gun. Therefore, they have recommended Hoyt not be charged with a crime. The sheriff's office said Hoyt joined as a trainee in 2019 and has never had disciplinary issues. The sheriff, however, determined that Hoyt violated department policies and suspended her. She is required to undergo remedial training. De Reivera is expected to make a full recovery.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nSpecial thanks to Shout-Out Supporters on Patreon:\n- Rob Winton\n- 'The Chocolate Thief'\n- 'Jacob from Wisconi'\n- 'gorey hole'\n- Gianni M.\n- Charles Cooper\n- Joe\n- Cooper Malley\n- Luis Perez\n- Chris Wesley\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6g0JHVCDn7U/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UCXMYxKMh3prxnM_4kYZuB3g","channelTitle":"PoliceActivity","duration":"PT2M56S","viewCount":"401893","likeCount":"15348","commentCount":"5936","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDyK2zVsJSyquSdp7IVNEDTH","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REeUsyelZzSlN5cXVTZHA3SVZORURUSC5DNkMwRUI2MkI4QkI4NDFG","playlistPosition":41},{"videoId":"0Y3apoPH15A","publishedAt":"2022-10-27T21:32:58Z","title":"Sergeant does what she wants!","description":"https://www.facebook.com/DBSDPS\n\nInformation about the crash found above on their fb page \n\nWhile investigating a tip that two officers allegedly  on October 5th and 6th 2022, brought their 3 year old to the police department and utilized the jail cell for some type of potential pottytraining I met these two.","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0Y3apoPH15A/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UCr36b7c1t0Tz0fDnpf7tHow","channelTitle":"James Madison Audits","duration":"PT4M35S","viewCount":"51606","likeCount":"2696","commentCount":"272","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDyK2zVsJSyquSdp7IVNEDTH","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REeUsyelZzSlN5cXVTZHA3SVZORURUSC5DRUQwODMxQzUyRTlGRkY3","playlistPosition":42},{"videoId":"VXvaPm7BQKY","publishedAt":"2022-10-28T15:21:21Z","title":"Rochester Police Officer Shoots Suspect Who Charged at Him With an Axe","description":"* (Disclaimer: This video content is intended for educational and informational purposes only) *\nRochester, Minnesota ‚Äî On July 29, 2022, at approximately 10:59 p.m., Officer Bottcher responded to a call at a Domino‚Äôs Pizza in Rochester. The report indicated a man with an axe robbed the Dominos and fled in a white van with out of state license plates and a ladder rack. Witnesses described the plates as having a light blue background and mountains. The suspect was described as a white male with panty hose over his face. The axe was reported to have a blue handle. Statements were obtained from the witnesses and Officer Bottcher finished his investigation at the scene. He cleared and went to write up reports from the incident. Approximately two hours after the robbery Officer Bottcher observed a van matching the description pass by him traveling southbound on Broadway. Officer Bottcher pulled out to catch up to the van to see if the plates matched the description given at the scene of the robbery. He did not have his lights or sirens activated. Near the 2800 block of Broadway Avenue South Officer Bottcher was able to see that the plates matched the description of those from the robbery. He did not activate his emergency lights and sirens at that time but did notify dispatch that he was possibly following a robbery suspect. \n\nOfficer Bottcher did not want to stop the vehicle until another officer was present because of the witness reports that the suspect was armed with an axe. The van began driving on the shoulder of the road. The driver made it appear that he was going onto the Hwy 52 northbound ramp but instead swerved back onto Hwy 63 southbound. The van then veered onto the Hwy 52 southbound ramp. Officer Bottcher confirmed the plate and notified dispatch that the driver knew he was behind him. The van merged onto Hwy 52 southbound and drove below the speed limit for a short distance. The van came to a stop and then made a U turn, so it was going the wrong way on the Hwy 52 southbound ramp. Due to the danger of a head on collision with oncoming traffic, Officer Bottcher activated his emergency lights and sirens. The van stopped in the middle of the road going the wrong way on the southbound ramp from Highway 63 to Highway 52. Officer Bottcher stopped his vehicle and observed the van door open. The driver of the vehicle, later identified as Joshua C. Hippler, jumped out and began advancing toward Officer Bottcher. Hippler had an axe in his hand and was swinging it.\n\nOfficer Bottcher pulled his handgun and repeatedly ordered Hippler to drop the axe and to get back into the vehicle. Hippler continued to advance toward Bottcher. Hippler was yelling that Officer Bottcher should kill him. Officer Bottcher retreated backwards to get some distance between himself and Hippler, while repeatedly commanding Hippler to drop the axe. Hippler began zig zagging toward Officer Bottcher, swinging the axe and yelling at Officer Bottcher to kill him. Officer Bottcher continued to walk backwards and give commands for Hippler to drop the axe. Officer Bottcher had retreated away from his squad car and was able to see a civilian vehicle approaching from the South. He fired one shot at Hippler. Officer Bottcher paused his fire. It appeared as though the shot hit Hippler but he continued to advance and refused to drop the axe. He yelled for Officer Bottcher to ‚Äúfinish it.‚Äù As Hippler continued to advance toward him swinging the axe Officer Bottcher fired approximately five additional shots. Hippler fell to the ground but held on to the axe. Almost immediately other officers were on the scene. They secured the van, cleared the axe from Hippler and began rendering medical assistance to him. The ambulance arrived and took Hippler to the Mayo Clinic ER where he died as a result of his gunshot wounds.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nSpecial thanks to Shout-Out Supporters on Patreon:\n- 'HelloDarknessMyOldFriend'\n- 'coco Coco'\n- Rob Winton\n- 'The Chocolate Thief'\n- 'Jacob from Wisconi'\n- 'gorey hole'\n- Gianni M.\n- Charles Cooper\n- Joe\n- Cooper Malley\n- Luis Perez\n- Chris Wesley\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VXvaPm7BQKY/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UCXMYxKMh3prxnM_4kYZuB3g","channelTitle":"PoliceActivity","duration":"PT3M42S","viewCount":"189968","likeCount":"9085","commentCount":"1826","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDyK2zVsJSyquSdp7IVNEDTH","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REeUsyelZzSlN5cXVTZHA3SVZORURUSC41MzY4MzcwOUFFRUU3QzEx","playlistPosition":43},{"videoId":"3uvr5hw9X8g","publishedAt":"2022-10-28T20:36:19Z","title":"This is how cops earn the hate.","description":"When a patrol officer refused to give his name, I asked the sergeant for it..

Reeves documents terrible trends and suggests solutions that don't come at the expense of women.\n\nhttps://reason.com/video/\n\nOver the past 50 years, boys and men have lost ground at school and work and they're living shorter lives. They're less likely than women to graduate from high school and college¬†or to earn advanced degrees. They're dropping out of the labor force in record numbers and account for two-thirds of so-called deaths of despair stemming from suicide, alcoholism, and drug overdoses..\n\nThe Brookings Institution scholar Richard V. Reeves documents these and other, equally dark developments in Of Boys and Men: Why the Modern Male Is Struggling, Why It Matters, and What To Do About It.

He stood beside Florida governor Ron DeSantis as he announced the \"Stop WOKE Act,\" on which Rufo has consulted. He's advised state lawmakers around the country on k-12 and higher education bills. And after the Walt Disney Company publicly opposed one of DeSantis' education bills, Rufo published leaked videos of internal meetings in which one executive producer discussed her \"not-at-all secret gay agenda\" and a production coordinator referenced a tracking tool meant to boost the representation of trans and \"gender non-conforming\" characters. Boycotts of Disney ensued, and DeSantis eventually revoked the company's special governance district.\r\n\r\nReason's Nick Gillespie and Zach Weissmueller discuss with Rufo his war on \"woke,\" what further policy changes he seeks, and what libertarians should think about his objectives and tactics in the livestream embedded above.","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/94GDPOFH6_w/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UC0uVZd8N7FfIZnPu0y7o95A","channelTitle":"ReasonTV","duration":"PT1H14M15S","viewCount":"13685","likeCount":"472","commentCount":"388","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDxQssYjQexIV35bM_GbbPCQ","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REeFFzc1lqUWV4SVYzNWJNX0diYlBDUS5CMEQ2Mjk5NTc3NDZFRUNB","playlistPosition":14},{"videoId":"oq8lF25Z_EQ","publishedAt":"2022-10-20T21:35:48Z","title":"üö®NYC MAYOR ERIC ADAMS RESPONDSüö®","description":"","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oq8lF25Z_EQ/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UCEE8w-v6Gg4j3ze3oX-urEw","channelTitle":"Project Veritas Action","duration":"PT1M28S","viewCount":"84951","likeCount":"6131","commentCount":"1631","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDxQssYjQexIV35bM_GbbPCQ","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REeFFzc1lqUWV4SVYzNWJNX0diYlBDUS45RjNFMDhGQ0Q2RkFCQTc1","playlistPosition":15},{"videoId":"SjQY3foEIuM","publishedAt":"2022-10-21T17:11:42Z","title":"KFBK Sacramento News Radio Airs #NYCLeaks & Termination of NYC Mayor Eric Adams Staffer, Chris Baugh","description":"Subscribe to our Project Veritas Action Mailing List: https://secure3.convio.net/pv/site/SPageNavigator/pva_email_sign_up.html\n\nDONATE: https://www.projectveritasaction.com/donate/\n\nFounded by James O‚ÄôKeefe in 2014, the mission of Project Veritas Action Fund (AKA Project Veritas Action) is to:\n\nInvestigate and expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud and other misconduct.\n\nIn order to expand upon the scope of investigative journalistic activities conducted by or under the supervision of James O‚ÄôKeefe, Project Veritas Action has been formed to ensure that we use an abundance of caution to see that we are in full compliance with both the letter and spirit of the law.\n\nThe mission of the Project Veritas Action Fund is to further the common good and general welfare of the citizens of the United States by conducting investigations into waste, fraud, abuse, corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing and other misconduct for the purpose of educating the public, stakeholders, policymakers and communities in order to create a more ethical and transparent society.\n\nProject Veritas Action Fund is a 501C4 organization.","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SjQY3foEIuM/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UCEE8w-v6Gg4j3ze3oX-urEw","channelTitle":"Project Veritas Action","duration":"PT56S","viewCount":"5584","likeCount":"1270","commentCount":"122","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDxQssYjQexIV35bM_GbbPCQ","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REeFFzc1lqUWV4SVYzNWJNX0diYlBDUS4zQzFBN0RGNzNFREFCMjBE","playlistPosition":16},{"videoId":"gl5o37HdpVA","publishedAt":"2022-10-21T23:14:10Z","title":"Is Gen Z Too SENSITIVE?

It has become known for scary movies, candy, costumes and mischief. But there is a deep, universal tradition behind Halloween, also known as the Festival of the Dead, All Souls Day or Feast of the Ancestors. This festival is observed around the world, in the northern and southern hemispheres at the SAME time of year. In this video, we take a dive down the rabbit hole with Randall Carlson to uncover the mysterious origin of Halloween. \n\nRandall Carlson is a master builder and designer, a geologist, anthropologist and historian. He specializes in sacred geometry, ancient civilizations, climate and environmental change, myths, legends, cosmic cycles and catastrophes. He is a proponent of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, and has theorized about the extinction of historical advanced human civilizations. \n\nGet the complete, in depth halloween lecture from Randal Carlson at https://www.howtube.com/13916\nTo learn more about Randall please visit https://randallcarlson.com/\nCheck out Randall's Podcast, Kosmographia https://www.youtube.com/c/TheRandallCarlson\nTo learn about geology tours with Randall https://randallcarlson.com/\n\nSpecial thanks to the Lowell Observatory for providing some of the astronomy footage.\n\nThank you for watching.

And Taylor Swift apparently hooked up with a trans model. #JohnFetterman #PASEN #taylorswift \n\nCome See Standup! - http://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tour\n\nTry the Walther!

He finds that they almost always have far more obvious explanations.\n\nfull text and links: https://reason.com/video/2022/10/25/that-fuzzy-blob-is-not-a-ufo/\n\n\"I'm kind of unpopular in the UFO community because‚Ä¶I have a bit of a negative outlook, and they prefer things to be aliens,\" says science writer Mick West. \"All the UFO videos we have are blurry, and it's not because alien spaceships are blurry. It's because when you zoom in, you see that it's not an alien spaceship. At least so far.\"\n\nWest is the author of Escaping the Rabbit Hole: How to Debunk Conspiracy Theories Using Facts, Logic, and Respect, and he runs a popular YouTube channel where he takes a detailed look at alleged UFO sightings, finding that phenomena thought to be visitors from another planet almost always have far more obvious explanations.\n\nIn recent years, the UFO craze has migrated from the grocery store rag the Weekly World News to The New York Times, Time, Politico, and Forbes, and the government has sunk considerable money into studying the issue.\n\n\"The government knows more about everything that it's willing to tell us,\" West told Reason. But \"it's dubious that it knows anything about UFOs being aliens.\"\n\nPhoto Credit: Illustration: Lex Villena; DoD, Rawpixelimages; FABIANO/SIPA/SIPA USA/Newscom; Gene Blevins/Polaris/Newscom; Richard Mroczynski/Red Dot/ZUMAPRESS/Newscom; Bill Clark/Newscom; Brittany A.

We choose to overcome our fears.\n\nWE ARE ALL LEADERS - Turning people into leaders. Completed staff work. Ownership.\n\nCOLLABORATION - Best not to work in silos. No one individual is as smart as all of us.\n\nRESILIENCE - Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. Never, ever, ever give up. We don't let mistakes or setbacks discourage us. Pursue perfection, knowing full well you will never attain it.\n\nMISSION DRIVEN - The best people are motivated by purpose. We are passionate and truly believe in our cause. We must be externally focused, not internally focused.\n\nMAKE THE STATUS QUO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE - We move mountains. Failure is not an option. We do whatever it takes.\n\nTHE TIP OF THE SPEAR - We are a loss leader. We do not shy away from conflict or litigation.\n\nEthical Values\nRule #1 ‚Äì Truth is paramount. Our reporting is fact based with clear and irrefutable video and audio content.  Truth is paramount. We never deceive our audience. We do not distort the facts or the context. We do not ‚Äúselectively edit.‚Äù\n\nRule #2 ‚Äì We do not break the law. We maintain one-party consent when recording someone is inherently moral and ethical. We never record when there is zero-party consent. In areas where we are required to have consent from all parties, we seek legal guidance regarding the expectation of privacy‚Äôs impact on our right to record.\n\nRule #3 ‚Äì We adhere to the 1st Amendment rights of others. During our investigations we do not disrupt the peace. We do not infringe on the 1st Amendment rights of others.\n\nRule #4 ‚Äì The Zekman Test. The undercover investigations we pursue are judged by us to be of ‚Äúvital public interest‚Äù and ‚Äúprofound importance.‚Äù The Zekman Test is our baseline. Undercover investigative reporting is necessary because, ‚Äú...there‚Äôs no other way to get the story...‚Äù Whereas the Society of Professional Journalists allows for undercover techniques, if undercover techniques are necessary to expose issues of vital public importance; we believe they are not only allowed but required.\n\nRule #5 ‚Äì We Protect the Innocent When Possible - Embarrassing private details are not to be investigated. We stay away from irrelevant embarrassingly intimate details about private citizens personal lives. We look for individual wrong-doing and judge its public importance. The irrelevant religious or sexual dispositions of our targets are not to be investigated.\n\nRule #6 ‚Äì Transparency. Our methods & tactics must be reasonable and defensible. We use the ‚ÄúTwelve Jurors on Our Shoulder‚Äù rule. The work has to be done with such a degree of integrity that it can withstand scrutiny in both law & ethics. We are comfortable with transparency. We must be willing to be ready to disclose our methods upon publication.\n\nRule #7 ‚Äì Verifying and Corroborate Stories ‚Äì Evaluate impact on third parties and Newsworthiness of Statements Alone.We consistently consider the probable truth or falsity of statements, examine any reasons to doubt the veracity of underlying assertions and whether the assertions are newsworthy.

In this video, I will handle a more technical response based on facts that will make you understand that this  \"Cyber\" guy and other people like him have completely no understanding of the risks to us individually and as a society.\n\nLouis Rossmann Video - You don't deserve privacy if you're not important.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQKDL9VUzfs\n-----------------------------------\nBraX2 Privacy Phone is now available on https://brax.me.

What could possibly go wrong?\n\nTurns out paper companies were already using a pure biofuel known as \"black liquor,\" which is produced during the paper-making process. It's a super convenient energy source to run paper plants and mills, but only blended fuels were eligible for the tax credit.¬†\n\nSo paper companies bought fossil fuel they didn't need, added it to the biofuel they were already using, and instantly qualified for very generous \"blended alternative fuel\" credits. Exactly the opposite of the tax credits' intent, but sometimes it all boils down to paper.\n\nBillboard Bans\n\nThe year: 1968\nThe Problem: Billboards cluttering the scenic vistas of Vermont\nThe Solution: Ban Billboards.\n\nSounds like a great idea with the best of intentions. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nAs the billboards came down, something new popped up: a 12-foot gorilla holding up a Volkswagen. A giant squirrel in a striped bathing suit. A 19-foot genie holding a carpet.¬†\n\n\"A veritable zoo of Gargantuan concrete sculptures\" all in the name of public art.¬†\n\nIt all seems a bit cute until a development dispute with the local bureaucracy results in a 700 lb middle finger on a 16-foot pole.¬†¬†\n\nEnjoy the view, Vermont!\n\nEqual Pay in Colorado\n\nThe Year: 2019\nThe Problem: The Gender Pay Gap\nThe Solution: The Colorado Equal Pay for Equal Work Act‚Äîa bevy of new regulations on employers, including a requirement that all forms of compensation be disclosed as part of every job listing, and a ban on asking job candidates about their salary history.\n\nSounds like a great idea with the best of intentions. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nNot only does the law open up companies to new legal liabilities and administrative burdens, but it also hinders employer flexibility when it comes to hiring. As a result, some companies like Samsung, Century 21, Cigna, IBM, Nike, even PETA have simply excluded Colorado from their remote job listings.\n\nCan't have a pay gap if you don't have a paycheck!

A residence's number of windows increases with relative wealth and is easily observed and verified from afar. A perfect revenue generator is born!¬†\n\nSounds like a great idea! With the best of intentions. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nTo avoid higher taxes, houses were built with fewer windows, and existing windows were bricked up. Tenements were charged as single dwellings, putting them in a higher tax bracket, which then led to rising rents or windowless apartments. The lack of ventilation and sunlight led to greater disease prevalence, stunted growth, and one rather irate Charles Dickens.¬†\n\nIt took more than 150 years for politicians to see the error of their ways‚Äîperhaps because their view was blocked by bricks.¬†\n\nLoonie Ladies\nThe Year: 1992\nThe Problem: Nude dancing is degrading to women and ruining the moral fabric of Alberta, Canada.\n\nThe Solution: Establish a one-meter buffer zone between patrons and dancers.\n\nSounds like total buzzkill! With puritanical intentions. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nIt turns out that dancers earn most of their money in the form of tips, and dollar bills don't fly through the air very well. Thus, the measure designed to protect dancers from degrading treatment resulted in \"the loonie toss\"‚Äîa creepy ritual where naked women are pelted with Canadian one-dollar coins, which are known as loonies.\n\nWay to make the ladies feel special, Alberta.¬†\n\nGallant Grocers\nThe Year: 2021\nThe Problem: Local bureaucrats need to look like they care.\n\nThe Solution: Mandate that grocery stores provide \"hero pay\" to their workers.\n\nSounds like a great idea! With the best of intentions. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nBesides the fact that these ordinances may preempt federal labor and equal protection laws, a 28 percent pay raise for employees can be catastrophic to grocery stores that traditionally operate on razor-thin margins. As a result, many underperforming stores closed, resulting in a \"hero pay\" of sudden unemployment.\n\nDon't spend it all in one place!\n\nWritten and produced by Meredith and Austin Bragg; narrated by Austin Bragg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LivNv0AX1U4/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UC0uVZd8N7FfIZnPu0y7o95A","channelTitle":"ReasonTV","duration":"PT2M33S","viewCount":"160240","likeCount":"9857","commentCount":"495","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDxS8SyjZamcvQkgLeV-e2lK","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REeFM4U3lqWmFtY3ZRa2dMZVYtZTJsSy4wOTA3OTZBNzVEMTUzOTMy","playlistPosition":4},{"videoId":"aAyPWcqiwzY","publishedAt":"2022-01-14T15:28:27Z","title":"Great Moments in Unintended Consequences (Vol. 5)","description":"Good intentions, bad results.\n\n------------------\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/ReasonTV?sub_confirmation=1\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reason.Magazine/\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/reason\n\nReason is the planet's leading source of news, politics, and culture from a libertarian perspective. Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines.\n----------------\n\nHere are even more of Reason's \"great moments in unintended consequences\"‚Äîstories of when something that sounds like a terrific idea goes horribly wrong. \n\nPart 1: The Transcontinental Tango\n\nThe year: 1862.\n\nThe problem: There's no railroad connecting coastal elites!\n\nThe solution: Pay rail companies for each mile of track laid for a brand new transcontinental railroad.\n\nSounds like a great idea, with the best of intentions. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nWhile Congress has never been great at keeping an eye on spending, it's even worse at it during a Civil War. With no one looking, the Union Pacific unnecessarily lengthened the route, adding miles of track and pocketing almost half a million dollars.\n\nAfter two and a half years of construction, the Union Pacific laid track all the way from Omaha to‚Ä¶40 miles outside of Omaha.\n\nI choo-choo-choose to screw taxpayers.\n\nPart 2: Burning Cash\n\nThe year: 2012.\n\nThe problem: An over-reliance on fossil fuels in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe solution: A subsidy for heat generated from renewable sources.\n\nSounds like a great idea, with the best of intentions. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nWell, it turns out the rate paid by the subsidy was greater than the cost of the fuel being used‚Äîso the more wood pellets you burned, the greater your profit. Voila: the \"Cash for Ash\" program, with farmers heating empty buildings just to collect a paycheck.\n\nIn the fallout, Northern Ireland's first minister refused to stand aside during any inquiry, the deputy first minister resigned in protest, the Northern Ireland Assembly dissolved, and the executive branch collapsed for almost three full years.\n\nNot to mention a whole lot of taxpayer dollars up in smoke.\n\nPart 3. All right, fine. We'll do the cobra thing.¬†\n\nThe year: Uhhh‚Ä¶some time in the 19th century? Maybe? Not sure. Might not even be true. Who knows?\n\nThe problem: The English colonial city of Delhi is infested with venomous cobras.\n\nThe solution: Give money to anyone who brings in a dead cobra.\n\nSounds like a great idea, with the best of intentions. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nIt didn't take long for folks to realize that the bounty paid for a dead cobra was greater than the cost of raising a cobra. Once city officials got wind of lucrative snake breeding farms, they repealed the bounty‚Äîleading cobra farmers to release their now worthless snakes into the wild. Net result: more cobras than ever, a lot of wasted cash, and a book by a German guy with a title that sounds like it's straight out of G.I. Joe.\n\nWhile the veracity of the cobra story is hard to pin down, a similar story was documented in Hanoi under French colonial rule‚Äîonly this time the issue was rats, with a bounty paid for every rat tail brought to the authorities. It wasn't long before officials began to notice rats without tails, having been set free by rat catchers with a basic understanding of economics.\n\nBut don't worry, we learned our lesson and it never happened ag‚Äî\n\nIn Fort Benning, Georgia, where the feral pig population was out of control, the bounty‚Äîfor some forehead slapping reason‚Äîwas pig tails, which once again‚Ä¶blah, blah, blah‚Ä¶more pigs.\n\nThey eventually discontinued the bounty, so don't worry, everything is swine now.\n\nGreat moments in unintended consequences.

What could possibly go wrong?\n\nCitizens got around the ban by buying a second car‚Äîoften a cheaper, older, and less efficient car. Having more, crappier cars in circulation failed to fix the problem and, according to a number of studies, air pollution actually increased after the restrictions were imposed.\n\nBut not to worry, politicians saw the error of their ways and in 2008‚Ä¶.expanded the program to include Saturdays. \n\nPart 2: Boat Taxes\n\nThe Year: 1773.\n\nThe problem: Britain needs money!\n\nThe solution: Collect port and lighthouse fees on merchant ships based on their length and width.\n\nSounds like a great idea with the best of intentions. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nIt turns out people don't like paying taxes. Since ships were charged by width and length but not depth, shipbuilders maximized cargo capacity while minimizing taxes by building deep, sluggish, flat-bottomed, flat-sided vessels‚Äîa recipe for instability. While Britain's Navy was ruling the sea, their unsightly and unmanageable merchant ships were a laughingstock.\n\nOn the plus side, the taxman can't reach you on the bottom of the sea.\n\nPart 3: Airplanes Fly Empty\n\nThe year: 2020.\n\nThe problem: A global pandemic straining the American airline industry.\n\nThe solution: A $60 billion bailout to rescue airlines and maintain continuity of service.\n\nSounds like a great idea with the best of intentions. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nWith concerns over COVID, air passenger rates plummeted as much as 95 percent. But since airlines were mandated to maintain a minimum level of service to qualify for the emergency government funding, airlines were forced to continue flying planes‚Ä¶even if there was no one on board. Voila! American skies were quickly filled with \"ghost flights\"‚Äînearly empty planes crisscrossing the country so the industry could qualify for billions of taxpayer funds.\n\nWritten and produced by Meredith and Austin Bragg; additional research by Natalie Dowzicky; narrated by Austin Bragg.","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Oztz17JUpr0/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UC0uVZd8N7FfIZnPu0y7o95A","channelTitle":"ReasonTV","duration":"PT2M39S","viewCount":"89890","likeCount":"6183","commentCount":"286","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDxS8SyjZamcvQkgLeV-e2lK","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REeFM4U3lqWmFtY3ZRa2dMZVYtZTJsSy41MzJCQjBCNDIyRkJDN0VD","playlistPosition":6},{"videoId":"5hwuRkJMo_4","publishedAt":"2022-05-04T13:33:46Z","title":"Great Moments in Unintended Consequences (Vol. 7)","description":"Good intentions, bad results.\n\nWatch the whole series here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oztz17JUpr0&list=PLBuns9Evn1w9XhnH7vVh_7C65wJbaBECK\n\nhttps://reason.com/video/2022/05/04/great-moments-in-unintended-consequences-vol-7/\n-------\nPart 1: Road Kill\n\nThe year: 2012.\n\nThe problem: Driving fatalities on Texas roads!\n\nThe solution: Implement a simple, cost-effective awareness campaign by displaying crash death totals on highway message boards.\n\nSounds like a great idea, with the best of intentions, what could possibly go wrong?\n\nIn order to read these messages, passing motorists must look away from the road.¬†\n\nAccidents along roads with new displays increased by 4.5 percent within 10 km of the sign, according to one study‚Äîamounting to an additional 2,600 crashes and 16 deaths per year in Texas.\n\nNot good news, considering more than half of states in the nation have deployed these signs on their roadways.¬†\n\nPart 2: Bottle Throttle\n\nThe year: 2013\n\nThe problem: Bottled water consumption at the University of Vermont creating waste!\n\nThe solution: Eliminate single-use bottled water from campus vending machines, give away reusable containers, and spend $100,000 to add filling stations around campus.\n\nSounds like a great idea with the best of intentions. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nStudents don't always remember things, like their reusable water bottles. Faced with limited choices, a study revealed the demand for sugary drinks on campus surged 25 percent and plastic bottle use per capita had increased by 6 percent.\n\nSome ideas shouldn't be recycled.\n\nPart 3: No Way, Fianc√©\n\nThe year: 1900\n\nThe problem:¬†Argentine bachelors sucking up valuable resources without producing more citizens.¬†\n\nThe solution:¬†A bachelor tax! A strangely popular feature of the time, but with a special waiver for those gentlemen whose proposals were turned down. No need to pour salt in that wound come tax day.¬†\n\nSounds like a bizarrely antiquated idea, with the best of intentions, what could possibly go wrong?\n\nThe tax exemption gave rise to an entirely new vocation: professional rejectors! These entrepreneurial ladies would swear to authorities that a gentleman tried‚Äîand failed‚Äîto win their hand.

And unlike most rent control initiatives, the new law also applies to new apartment buildings, discouraging housing construction and investment. Which is why¬†multi-family building permits are down over 80 percent in St. Paul, while ramping up in the rest of the state.\n\nWhich explains why St. Paul is the patron saint of tent makers.\n\nPart Two: Arizona Alt Fuel\n\nThe year: 2000\n\nThe problem: Not enough alternative fuel is being used in Arizona.\n\nThe solution: Generous tax credits for new vehicles to incentivize buyers to add an alternative fuel tank.\n\nThe subsidy allowed tens of thousands to buy fully loaded luxury SUVs at a nearly 50 percent discount, as long as they were converted to add a secondary one-gallon alternative fuel tank that would likely never be filled up. The plan wound up costing the state hundreds of millions and actually increased gasoline consumption.\n\nTanks for nothing!\n\nPart Three: Georgia Ballot Access\n\nThe year: 1940\n\nThe problem: Communists.\n\nThe solution: Bar communists from appearing on ballots.\n\nSounds‚Ä¶pretty unconstitutional, with questionable intentions. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nRestrictive ballot access measures were codified in 1943, requiring signatures from 5 percent of a congressional district's voters. Later, more requirements were added, including forcing signatures to be notarized and the imposition of qualifying fees. It's now been over 60 years since a third-party candidate has muscled through the restrictions to appear on the ballot for any congressional race in Georgia.\n\nWritten and produced by Meredith and Austin Bragg; narrated by Austin Bragg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XKokzWvn35s/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UC0uVZd8N7FfIZnPu0y7o95A","channelTitle":"ReasonTV","duration":"PT2M33S","viewCount":"96739","likeCount":"6868","commentCount":"569","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDxS8SyjZamcvQkgLeV-e2lK","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REeFM4U3lqWmFtY3ZRa2dMZVYtZTJsSy45NDk1REZENzhEMzU5MDQz","playlistPosition":8}]},{"playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDynKV3YkbarjC4JdZV_u6lc","title":"üìï History","description":"","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nO3pYTRWT2w/mqdefault.jpg","itemCount":53,"newItemCount":1,"videos":[{"videoId":"nO3pYTRWT2w","publishedAt":"2021-11-20T16:00:31Z","title":"Alexander Hamilton: The Father of the American Economy","description":"To start comparing quotes and simplify your insurance purchase, check out Policygenius: https://policygenius.com/BIOGRAPHICS.

He was a politician in colonial Massachusetts, a leader of the movement that became the American Revolution, and one of the architects of the principles of American republicanism that shaped the political culture of the United States. He was a second cousin to his fellow Founding Father, President John Adams.\n\nAdams was born in Boston, brought up in a religious and politically active family. A graduate of Harvard College, he was an unsuccessful businessman and tax collector before concentrating on politics. He was an influential official of the Massachusetts House of Representatives and the Boston Town Meeting in the 1760s, and he became a part of a movement opposed to the British Parliament's efforts to tax the British American colonies without their consent. His 1768 Massachusetts Circular Letter calling for colonial non-cooperation prompted the occupation of Boston by British soldiers, eventually resulting in the Boston Massacre of 1770. Adams and his colleagues devised a committee of correspondence system in 1772 to help coordinate resistance to what he saw as the British government's attempts to violate the British Constitution at the expense of the colonies, which linked like-minded Patriots throughout the Thirteen Colonies. Continued resistance to British policy resulted in the 1773 Boston Tea Party and the coming of the American Revolution. Adams was actively involved with colonial newspapers publishing accounts of colonial sentiment over British colonial rule, which were fundamental in uniting the colonies.\n\nParliament passed the Coercive Acts in 1774, at which time Adams attended the Continental Congress in Philadelphia which was convened to coordinate a colonial response. He helped guide Congress towards issuing the Continental Association in 1774 and the Declaration of Independence in 1776, and he helped draft the Articles of Confederation and the Massachusetts Constitution. Adams returned to Massachusetts after the American Revolution, where he served in the state senate and was eventually elected governor.\n\nOther AMERICAN HEROES: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDsADVyAXB4FzCRTpVlu-zUN-misKbvNA\n\nCitations\n\nBoston National Historical Park.

The American Patriots in the Thirteen Colonies won independence from Great Britain, becoming the United States of America. They defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War in alliance with France and others.\n\nMembers of American colonial society argued the position of \"no taxation without representation\", starting with the Stamp Act Congress in 1765. They rejected the authority of the British Parliament to tax them because they lacked members in that governing body. Protests steadily escalated to the Boston Massacre in 1770 and the burning of the Gaspee in Rhode Island in 1772, followed by the Boston Tea Party in December 1773, during which Patriots destroyed a consignment of taxed tea. The British responded by closing Boston Harbor, then followed with a series of legislative acts which effectively rescinded Massachusetts Bay Colony's rights of self-government and caused the other colonies to rally behind Massachusetts. In late 1774, the Patriots set up their own alternative government to better coordinate their resistance efforts against Great Britain; other colonists preferred to remain aligned to the Crown and were known as Loyalists or Tories.\n\nTensions erupted into battle between Patriot militia and British regulars when the king's army attempted to capture and destroy Colonial military supplies at Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. The conflict then developed into a global war, during which the Patriots (and later their French, Spanish, and Dutch allies) fought the British and Loyalists in what became known as the American Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì83). Each of the thirteen colonies formed a Provincial Congress that assumed power from the old colonial governments and suppressed Loyalism, and from there they built a Continental Army under the leadership of General George Washington. The Continental Congress determined King George's rule to be tyrannical and infringing the colonists' rights as Englishmen, and they declared the colonies free and independent states on July 2, 1776. The Patriot leadership professed the political philosophies of liberalism and republicanism to reject monarchy and aristocracy, and they proclaimed that all men are created equal.\n\nThe Continental Army forced the redcoats out of Boston in March 1776, but that summer the British captured and held New York City and its strategic harbor for the duration of the war. The Royal Navy blockaded ports and captured other cities for brief periods, but they failed to defeat Washington's forces. The Patriots unsuccessfully attempted to invade Canada during the winter of 1775‚Äì76, but successfully captured a British army at the Battle of Saratoga in October 1777, and the French entered the war as allies of the United States as a result. The war later turned to the American South where the British under the leadership of Charles Cornwallis captured an army at Charleston, South Carolina in early 1780 but failed to enlist enough volunteers from Loyalist civilians to take effective control of the territory while fighting partisans. A combined American‚ÄìFrench force captured a second British army at Yorktown in the fall of 1781, effectively ending the war in North America. The Treaty of Paris, signed September 3, 1783, formally ended the conflict, confirming the new nation's complete separation from the British Empire. The United States took possession of nearly all the territory east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes, with the British retaining control of Canada and Spain taking Florida.\n\nAmong the significant results of the revolution was the creation of a new Constitution of the United States. The new Constitution established a relatively strong federal national government that included an executive, a national judiciary, and a bicameral Congress that represented states in the Senate and the population in the House of Representatives. The Revolution also resulted in the migration of around 60,000 Loyalists to other British territories, especially British North America (Canada).","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W74uOnlaEJg/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UCtrtm7VZhpcoUeJ1OxGKeWQ","channelTitle":"TDC - World History Documentaries","duration":"PT3H37M16S","viewCount":"711494","likeCount":"6678","commentCount":"1015","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDynKV3YkbarjC4JdZV_u6lc","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REeW5LVjNZa2JhcmpDNEpkWlZfdTZsYy40NzZCMERDMjVEN0RFRThB","playlistPosition":8},{"videoId":"Ai7vRu6N_9g","publishedAt":"2020-08-02T16:59:50Z","title":"George Washington: America‚Äôs First President & the Birth of a Nation | Full Documentary | Biography","description":"George Washington rose to prominence on the shoulders of his dynamic half-brother Lawrence, married wisely, and was enormously popular with the soldiers of Virginia and politicians of his day.

But what was the catalyst for it, what is the \"Renaissance factor\"? The Renaissance is an epoch unique in human history: Never before have art, culture, economics and science developed so rapidly within a single century. We search for the \"Renaissance factor\", that combination of influences that triggered a pivotal period in history. It is a journey through time from Ancient Rome to the Crusades and the Black Death in the 14th century, events that defined the developments of the Renaissance. We travel with Michelangelo to the major construction site that was to become St. Peter‚Äôs Basilica, to the banking houses of the Medicis and the workshop of Johannes Gutenberg. We examine some of the many innovations of the Renaissance such as linear perspective, the printing press and double-entry bookkeeping. We ask what these achievements mean to us today and how - almost half a millennium later - we continue to benefit from the \"Renaissance factor.\" And we delve deeper with the help of spectacular reenactments and our \"special investigators\" - modern-day trendsetters, scientists, business tycoons, fashion designers and artists.\n\nPart 2: https://youtu.be/_LMUWV1Tacs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

John Knox and his associates had completed the work of changing Scotland from Roman Catholicism to Protestantism.  The Scots felt that their pure religion of Biblical worship and doctrine along with their liberty which had cost so much was worth fighting for.\r\nThe struggle for religious and civil liberties during the 1600's was not with Romanism, but with the Episcopalians of England.  The British monarchy, which held both religious and civil authority tried to force its prayer book and church government of archbishops, bishops, deans and church laws upon the people of Scotland.  When King Charles I and his successors endeavored to force the Scots to conform, is when the conflict became severe and even bloody.  For over fifty years the Scots fought a long and bitter fight until 1688 when they succeeded in reestablishing Presbyterianism in Scotland.","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/enSBMqFblLI/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UChN9jV7m0tYwA5fgSLb7Pvg","channelTitle":"visionsonline","duration":"PT28M33S","viewCount":"80407","likeCount":"1013","commentCount":"77","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDynKV3YkbarjC4JdZV_u6lc","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REeW5LVjNZa2JhcmpDNEpkWlZfdTZsYy5DQ0MyQ0Y4Mzg0M0VGOEYw","playlistPosition":24},{"videoId":"8hXSarQeB3c","publishedAt":"2021-07-18T13:23:47Z","title":"The Reformation - 4K Documentary","description":"https://www.patreon.com/pike_and_shot_channel\n\nhttps://twitter.com/pikeandshotbat1\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PikeAndShotBattles/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pikeandshotbattles.documentaries.7\n\nThe Catholic Church is mired in corruption by the 16th century.In 1517 Martin Luther publishes his 95 Point Thesis at Wittenberg, starting the Protestant Reformation. He is summoned to the Diet of Worms, where Charles V declares him an outlaw. Along comes Frederick III of Saxony, Luther's prince to save him. The Magisterial Reformation succeeds not only in Germany, but in Sweden and Denmark too. The French and the English Reformations also start, but end with diverging results. Another consequence of the Reformation is the Knights Revolt and the Peasants War. \nIn 1521 Huldrych Zwingli begins the Swiss Reformation. Groups of Anabaptists also emerge in Z√ºrich. The Swiss Reformation continues with John Calvin.The Calvinist Reformation is particularly successful in France and the Low Countries, leading to religious wars.After the Council of Trent and the formation of the Jesuits, the Catholic Counter-Reformation picks up.\nCharles V is victorious in the First Schmalkaldic War, as Protestants are crushed at the Battle of M√ºhlberg. Nevertheless Charles is forced to grant religious freedom at the Peace of Augsburg in 1555. Confessionalism takes hold over Europe, and Catholics are on a crash course with Protestants...\n\nBibliography:\n\nCollinson, P (2006). The Reformation A History\nHarline, C (2017).

His pamphlets and books inspired ordinary people throughout the colonies of America to stand up for their rights and throw off the yoke of British domination. Soon after, these books were smuggled into France, where they inspired the Third Estate to agitate for the guarantee of their natural rights. Eventually, this grass roots activism would lead to the overthrow of the French Monarchy in the French Revolution, where Paine would be granted honorary citizenship, a seat in its parliament and a voice in the drafting of the French Republic's constitution. He would eventually go on to write on many issues of social justice, including abolition, universal suffrage, aged care, education, welfare, healthcare and anti-corruption in government. This occasionally made him a target of powerful people, and despite his heroic status, he was eventually marginalised and forgotten. Overshadowed by the major players who used his tireless campaigning to their advantage, Paine died in obscurity and poverty, having transformed the landscape of democracy across three continents, and was the source of many of our greatest achievements in civil discourse and progress over the last 250 years.\n#thomaspaine, #americanhero, #democracy, #frenchrevolution, #documentary \n\nFor a list of film and media sources used in this video montage please see end credits. \n\n\nIf you enjoy my content, leave your suggestions and comments below, and please consider making a donation via PayPal or sign up as a Patreon supporter to help me continue making these unfunded educational videos:\n\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=4D958V58PAVDU\nhttps://www.patreon.com/heroesandlegends\nhttps://buymeacoffee.com/infoQh            \n\nOr visit my Triarius Project website: https://triariusproject.com/\n\n\nERRATUM:\nPlease see below for any errors picked up by viewers post production:\n\n1.

Take the case of Mary Easty, for instance, who noticeably rocked the confidence of the persecuting magistrates with her nobel defence. Despite being condemned as a witch and to be hanged on September 22nd, 1692, she focused on the paper beams that were holding up the court‚Äôs judicial procedures. Have the accusers recount their stories separately and compare them, she had urged. She pleaded for them to check again the accounts of 'some of these confessing witches‚Äô, arguing they had lied to save their own lives when pressured to identify more witches. These requests, if they were heard were not listened to, and she was hanged ‚Äòdrawing tears from the eyes of almost all present‚Äô.\n\nCopyright: DO NOT translate and re-upload our content on Youtube or other social media.\n\nSIMPLE HISTORY MERCHANDISE \n\nGet the Simple History books on Amazon: \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Turner-%60/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\nT-Shirts\n\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/simple-history-official-merch\n\nSimple history gives you the facts, simple!\n\nSee the book collection here:\n\nAmazon USA\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Turner/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\n\nAmazon UK\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Daniel-Turner/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Simple-History-549437675141192/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SimpleHistoryYT\n\n\nCredit:\nCreated by Daniel Turner (B.A. (Hons) in History, University College London) \nScript: \nNarrator:\n\nChris Kane\nhttps://vocalforge.com/\n\nWriter:\n\nNatasha Martell\n\nBlumber, Jess. ‚ÄúA Brief History of the Salem Witch Trials.‚Äù 2007.

Before I move on to the description of the new job, I want you to share this video with your friends, like it if you like it, and do not forget to write your opinion in the comments. I will be pleased. Happy viewing.\nNow it's time to move on to the description of this work. We see a beautiful forest with incredible trees. Yellowed leaves that carry their story and create their own fairy tale around them. In this work, we see a park, how I would like to walk through it, you too? Write in the comments. Imagine: walking in the park, yellow trees around you, fallen leaves rustling under your feet, and somewhere at this moment they fall, the sun peeps out from under the tree branches, and a light cool wind envelops you - incredible sensations. How often, in the earthly bustle, we do not notice all the beauty of nature, and in fact it is the most beautiful that we can see. I am very interested to know what is your favorite time of the year, share with me.\nThank you for watching this video. Take care of yourself, and all the best to you.

Last night over 50 injured Ukrainian soldiers were evacuated by DPR and Russian forces to a hospital for treatment in DPR. There were an additional 250 that surrendered and were taken to a DPR jail as prisoners. It is unknown exactly how many Ukrainians remain in the plant but today it is expected that more will be surrendering in mass. The major fighting in Mariupol came to an end and the majority of the heavy military equipment moved out of the city just before the Russian army declared victory in Mariupol back in April. Since then the fighting has been contained to the Azovstal plant and its territory. The DPR and Russian soldiers near the Azovstal say it is just a matter of time until the last Azov and Ukrainian soldiers surrender so the plant is clear and they say it will be soon. \nThis morning I went to the site of the Mass surrendering and gave a quick update on the ground to show you what it is really like.  The DPR and Russian forces are waiting and ready for the Ukrainians in Azovstal to surrender. Only time will tell when it is over at Azovstal\n\n\n#RussiaUkrainewar #Russia #Ukraine\nReport by Patrick Lancaster \nUS Navy veteran and independent crowd-funded journalist. \nOver the 8 years of the Ukraine War I made more video reports in anti-Ukraine Government (Donetsk People's Republic) controlled territory than any other western journalist.

At about 9:30 My team and I went to the Kuibyshevsky district of Donetsk after hearing reports of shelling there. After arriving the shelling continued and we spent the next 90 min carefully avoiding shelling as it rained down on this residential area so we could document the attack. While there and in this report we documented and saw with our own eyes impacts and damage to at least 8 apartment buildings, an Electronic equipment factory, a farmers market, and 3 small stores.  We came across a group of people digging through debris to find their friend's bodies( hopefully alive) after Ukraine shelled a market. As I came up one of the elderly man fell down while searching, so I helped him up and joined them in the search. we only found one of their friends(not alive). We could not find the other 2. I pray they made it out alive.\nWe saw one civilian killed by the shelling, one injured and 2 missing and presumed dead.\nTo be clear this location is one of the MANY that took heavy shelling throughout the day in Donetsk.\n\n\n#RussiaUkrainewar #Russia #Ukraine\nReport by Patrick Lancaster \nUS Navy veteran and independent crowd-funded journalist. \nI show what the western media will not show you. \n\n\n\n\nWe are very interested in what you think so please say what you think under this.

In this report, I show the voting, today last day of voting, in the Donetsk People's Republic controlled territory referendum to join Russia. Ukraine's government has begun accusing Russia of coercing residents to vote they are condemning them calling them a ‚Äòpropaganda show‚Äô but never the less the voting begins in Russian-controlled territory of what is internationally recognized as Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, & Lugansk Regions (Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics). We are on the ground covering all 4 areas that are having the referendums so you can see for yourself and make an educated opinion. In this report We show you some of the processes of the referendum in the Ukrainian port city of Berdyansk in the Zaporizhzhia region As you most probably know there have been huge developments in the Russia - Ukraine war this week. Most recently the NordStream pipeline is off. The west keeps supporting Ukraine with more and more weapons which seem to be antagonizing Russia. They continue to refuse to show the full story of what has been happening in Donbass for the last 8 years. The Russian President seems to have had enough and says Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons & any other means of mass destruction in case of a threat to territorial integrity and weapons of mass disruption are used on Russia. and he says ‚ÄúThis is not a bluff,‚Äù . The Russian Defense Minister Shoigu says Russia is at war with the collective West,\" and a Partial mobilization has been announced by Russia. The US has also privately warned Russia against using nuclear weapons.Of course, as always full English and Russian translated subtitles\n\n\n#russiaukrainewar    #Russia #Ukraine\n\nReport by Patrick Lancaster US Navy veteran and independent crowd-funded journalist.

Belarus served as a staging point for the offensive directed towards Kyiv which faltered in March and continues to be a base for Russian missiles and logistics. With Ukrainian victories in Kharkiv, Kherson, and the Donbas, will Putin force his ally Lukashenka to enter the war on his side?\n\nMusic Used:\nPrelude and Action - Kevin MacLeod\nMovement Proposition -

During the siege of Mariupol, he was captured and sentenced to death in a show trial by the Supreme Court of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), but was freed in September in a prisoner exchange.\n\nHis service in the Ukrainian marines makes him an active-duty soldier protected by the Geneva conventions on prisoners of war. However, Russian state media has portrayed him as a mercenary. Another British citizen, Aiden Aslin and the Moroccan Saadoun Brahim, received identical verdicts in the same trial.[4] British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss tweeted that: \"The judgement against them is an egregious breach of the Geneva convention.\" The defence attorney did not even ask for an explanation as to why the existing arguments against mercenary status were not been taken into consideration, simply saying instead that \"the guilt of my client has been fully established\".\n\nSupport Channel

Of Today, EVERYONE Is Wasting Money On Wired Cameras","description":"The EZVIZ CB8 Is like no other camera I've ever tried.\n\nThis video is sponsored by EZVIZ all opinions are my own.\n\n***UPDATE*** I Want to be clear that the EZVIZ can be set to flash the lights at burglars and will only chew through the  battery if you set it to always on mode!  As for the network issues; I took the camera to my friends house when I went for a BBQ last Saturday and the camera worked great in almost every part of his house.  There were a couple of dead spots, but nothing like the issues I've faced at my house.  I'm still working with EZVIZ to establish what it is about my network that the camera doesn't like, but I suspect you'll be fine.  You can always send it back to Amazon if you have the same issues.\n\nBUY THE EZVIZ CB8\nAs an Amazon Associate I will earn commission if you purchase through the below links at no cost to you üòä\nUK: https://amzn.to/3KmRM0z\nUS: Coming soon! : https://amzn.to/3wv9Yj6\n\nThis Video is a Review of the EZVIZ CB8 Pan and Tilt camera, an outdoor camera that works with Alexa and works with Google Home.  The CB8 is the best PTZ camera I've tried in 2022, and I am blown away to find that the solar panel has kept the battery at 100% even on cloudier days in the UK where we don't have a sun.\n\n=============================\nBUY ME A BEER\nDonate to the channel: http://paypal.me/PaulHibbert\nBecome a monthly contributor on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/paulhibbert\n==============================\n\nOTHER SMART HOME DEVICES I RECOMMEND\nAs an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.

The technician didn't mention if the headlights were salvageable or not. \n0:23 The technician said: \"customer drove the car in and in the middle of the parking lot her wheel fell off. We jacked up the right front and pulled it into the shop and found the bearings had been gone for a long time, replaced the front brakes & caliper, hub, and knuckle and the wheel as well had been ground down, brake pads are long gone and are probably in someone's tire.\"\n0:37 The technician doesn't know yet if his dealership took this vehicle on trade-in yet. Looks like they were driving on the spare tire. So most likely, they didn't have another spare so kept driving. \n0:49 The technician said: \"2019 Toyota Camry TAXI came in for a recall. The customer didn't mention anything about all the lights on (check engine, Collison, TPMS ) had to boost the car. He says just do the recall as I'm going to sell it.\" \n1:03 As shown the lower ball joint is broken into two pieces. From the look's of it, the customer might have hit something which snapped it in half. Could be that it was wear and tear as well since you can't see any grease in the ball joint (but I've never seen that before).\n1:15 The customer didn't order the correct wheels with the correct offset. So in this case the customer could order some wheel spacers, or buy the correct wheels with the correct offset. As you see in the clip, the backside of the wheel/spokes is rubbing against the brake caliper and that's why the customer's car couldn't move. \n1:25 The technician has no clue why the customer has different wheels/brakes. Maybe they got some used parts from a scrap yard.\n1:35 It seems to be a common issue, and Mazda has a TSB (Technical Service Bulletin) regarding this issue. More info here - https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/tsbs/2018/MC-10143977-9999.pdf\n1:41 Seen this happen to a lot of these Chrysler vans. It seems to be common to see the strut towers rust out and strut mounts fail.\n1:50 No extra info.\n2:06 No extra info from the viewer who sent this in. However, it definitely needs a tire and I'm sure the other 3 need to be replaced as well. \n2:15 People add body mounts to their vehicle to lift up the body (cab and box/bed in this case) so they can most likely fit bigger tires. This is a cheaper way instead of doing a lift kit that costs more. This one the customer did doesn't look to safe and you probably can't put much weight in the bed/box anymore.\n2:25 The technician said: \"Customer is willing to pay 4 hours labor to remove the forbidden goo plus one hour for R&I window regulator motor. They just moved to Florida from Colorado and didn't understand how hot and humid it REALLY is here. Window regulator motor shot due to forbidden goo interfering with window regulator motor. Instructed customer to replace deadening material with different material. \nUpdate II: Front passenger window also inop. due to the same reason. The customer has agreed to pay me double to do both doors and window regulators. Extra time later to remove all deadening material on other doors and replace with something more suitable for the Florida heat and humidity.\" \nThe customer used Stinger Roadkill which they bought online. \n2:45 The viewer who shared this said the shop is a quick walk from his home so that's probably why they didn't come off. The shop was apologetic and felt really bad, refunded the money, and redid the alignment.\n2:54 After a long hard day, clocking out causes some excitement.\n3:09 Outro.

The turbo is oil feed and the turbo seals were leaking into the exhaust side (hot side) of the turbo which caused the oil to pour out of the exhaust (hood stack) and onto everywhere on the truck.\n0:20 Some crazy \"curb rash\" on a customer's vehicle that just came in for a service. Look's like somebody did this on purpose it's so bad.\n0:30 The technician said: \"Aftermarket steel wheels rotted/rusted bad enough to crack and separate from the center hub.\"\n0:41 From the looks of it, the bolt that tightens the strut to the steering knuckle/spindle must have been loose to cause this. As the strut slides into the knuckle and it's just one bolt that holds it together.\n0:59 Look's like the customers drove into a parking barrier in a parking lot. From what we can see the oil pan is dented in, the transmission housing is cracked, the transmission pan is cracked, and the transmission mount is broken. They didn't mention how much the repairs cost.\n1:15 Missing brake pads, and brake caliper not bolted on the passenger rear side and re-used the old brake pads on the driver's side. Unsure why somebody would use all-new parts but not brake pads. \n1:31 The technician said: \"Customer complained about a wet dog smell from the AC a few weeks after maintenance and demands a free ac cleaning treatment, when getting the car inside we noticed a soaking wet raincoat and a dog bench / Carrier on the back seat. When we told him we found this he got angry 'do you think I'm stupid? My dog doesn't smell'.\"\n1:43 It's the drain for the convertible top. So all the water that collects on the top would make its way to the drain and leak out of the bottom of the car. But in this case, it got so full of water because the drain was plugged and it made its way to the window motor which most likely caused it to short out.\n2:00 Inner and outer tie-rod end on a VW Beetle. The inner tie rod (left side) is supposed to thread into the outer tie-rod end. As you can see it just slide's in. The technician thinks the jam nut was maybe loose so the inner tie-rod end was vibrating and slowly wore out the threads in the inner tie-rod. If you have any idea what you think happened. Let us know!\n2:10 Looks like the welds that hold the axle to the trailer broke. The customer is lucky nothing bad happened on his 200-mile trip. \n2:20 No brakes, rotors are halfway worn, and a loose wheel bearing.\nNo extra info. \n2:29 As mentioned the bolts for the lower control arm were almost all the way backed out. Seems like it's been that way for a while as the holes are slightly worn.\n2:43 Hyundai (didn't mention model) had a hole in the engine block and was still running. \n2:50 Most shops won't repair a tire if they have more than 3 leaks/holes. So this customer would need to get 4 new tires. Most likely picked up these roofing nails at a construction site.\n3:08 They didn't mention how this happened but my guess is that the tire was overfilled or damaged and shouldn't be taken out of service. The one person is lucky they moved!\n3:19 Outro.

As mentioned the customer just had a wheel fly off while driving on the highway. The technician said he know's why a wheel came off, considering all the nuts were loose.\n0:34 Hose clamps around a u-joint on the rear driveshaft of this customer's vehicle. The customer didn't mention this or the vibration they have when it came in to get new tires.\n0:38 200,000 miles / 321868 kilometres on this Hyundai Tucson. What you see is a very rusted rear sub-frame. The technician has no clue why the customer installed a new brake caliper and somehow did not see this.\n0:48 Let's hope the customer doesn't crash and the airbags deploy.\n0:58 Customer never had the vehicle inspected and a coil spring was replaced with this piece of wood. \n1:05 The customer agreed to pay the shop to check over the work and have them tighten the nuts for the sway bar links. \n1:27 The technician never got the full story from the customer on what they actually hit to bend the radiator, A/C condenser, and radiator supports.\n1:38 The technician said: \" I got a call later from the guy saying his motor won't start, after towing it to me I pulled the valve cover this is what I found..... Later I found out he put expanding foam 'cause he couldn't find seafoam...\"\n1:51 The customer didn't try replacing the battery but apparently towed it to another shop that had more experience than this one. The vacuum line to the brake booster is broken, and that's why they have a complaint about the brakes not working properly. \n2:32 Just a funny one as it's Halloween today.\n2:40 Looks to be aluminum foil tape that the customer covered their vehicle in.\n2:50 No extra info from the technician. \n3:08 13000 miles / 20921 kilometres on the vehicle. The technician said: \"It will need a new engine. It was grinding and had no oil pressure and had to be towed to a dealership.\"\nAs you see the drain plug is missing and the customer drove without oil for a while.\n3:20 The customer declined repairs to get a new oil pan gasket installed.\n3:30 \"I saw a video with a car that had pumpkins at the end of the exhaust that was making fire. I thought it would be cool with real coal.\"\n3:38 Outro.

Having a domestic defense industry provides a country with the capability of defending its territory and interests independently. Production of weapons, even if they are small arms, is an expensive and complex business however. It takes a lot of time, expert knowledge, and money to design the weapon, test it, and finally put it into production. That is why many countries resort to the license-production of firearms. It is far cheaper and more efficient to produce a weapon that another country has developed. it can however come at  the price of political and diplomatic strain. It is not uncommon to find that some countries resort to unlicensed weapon production. Weapon blueprints  can be obtained  through various methods, usually by industrial espionage, and used to make copycat weapons. Some of these weapons have only a couple of so-called ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù features, while others are complete clones of the originals. \n\n\nBecome a Simple History member: https://www.youtube.com/simplehistory/join\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/simplehistory\n\nCopyright: DO NOT translate and re-upload our content on Youtube or other social media.\n\nSIMPLE HISTORY MERCHANDISE \n\nGet the Simple History books on Amazon: \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Turner-%60/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\nT-Shirts\n\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/simple-history-official-merch\n\nSimple history gives you the facts, simple!\n\nSee the book collection here:\n\nAmazon USA\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Turner/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\n\nAmazon UK\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Daniel-Turner/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Simple-History-549437675141192/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SimpleHistoryYT\n\n\nCredit:\nCreated by Daniel Turner (B.A. (Hons) in History, University College London) \nScript: Dejan Milivojevic\nNarrator:\n\nChris Kane\nhttps://vocalforge.com/\n\nSources:\nhttps://pastebin.com/XWG2yRx4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6gxA9veS_3I/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UC510QYlOlKNyhy_zdQxnGYw","channelTitle":"Simple History","duration":"PT18M16S","viewCount":"2500143","likeCount":"62776","commentCount":"3819","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDyjvLZ_YtvWncb-4lHMZghl","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REeWp2TFpfWXR2V25jYi00bEhNWmdobC4xRDJGOTc4RkUxMzUwMUFG","playlistPosition":28},{"videoId":"_9mFrNJdoF0","publishedAt":"2022-07-22T14:00:31Z","title":"The Mystery of the Lake Michigan Triangle","description":"The Bermuda Triangle isn't the only watery region with a reputation for unexplainable events and tragedies.

Chinese-American immigrants first came to the States in the 1840s during the California Gold Rush, after which they settled into cities, creating the first American Chinatowns. Later on, they were recruited to help construct the railway system, during which Chinese workers faced hunger, death, and long working hours. Domestic conditions were also difficult, as very few Chinese women had immigrated to the US and those who did were often brought over as sex slaves and forced into prostitution. Nineteenth century Chinese immigrants played an important role in uniting the two coasts of the United States, even though the country itself, in many ways, turned its back on them.\n\n\n#ChineseLaborers #Railroads #WeirdHistory","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F8jazexfZh8/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UCc-N24Y5OA0gqbjBwe1ttfA","channelTitle":"Weird History","duration":"PT9M43S","viewCount":"159539","likeCount":"6365","commentCount":"823","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDyjvLZ_YtvWncb-4lHMZghl","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REeWp2TFpfWXR2V25jYi00bEhNWmdobC5EODkyNDMzRkJBNkQ2NkMz","playlistPosition":32},{"videoId":"isGNQILKM0A","publishedAt":"2022-07-24T17:15:00Z","title":"Why did Haiti and the Dominican Republic Break Up?

Robert McNamara, the US Secretary of Defense, was severely concerned; despite massive territorial gains, the North Vietnamese troops continued to move south freely and didn‚Äôt seem the least deterred from continuing with the conflict. \n\nIf the US didn‚Äôt shift its strategy, the war would become unwinnable. Thus, a new plan was devised: the US would use its air superiority to conduct swift hit and run strikes in enemy territory, prioritizing enemy fatalities over territorial gains. \n\nThe new ‚ÄòBody Count‚Äô or search and destroy approach began with Operation Attleboro, a massive air assault on the T√¢y Ninh province, which was being used by communist forces as the main supply area in the region.\n\nOn September 14, 1966, US troops boarded dozens of Huey helicopters to storm the T√¢y Ninh province in a series of daring probes. The strikes were moderately successful, with US troops inflicting many casualties on the communist forces and learning of a significant enemy operations base further in the north.\n\nBrigadier General Edward H. de Saussure then deployed two battalions to destroy the base before the enemy could reinforce it, but as the American helicopters darkened the sky as they approached the target area, they were in for a nasty surprise.\n\nAs soon as they landed, the US forces were attacked by communist troops hiding in the tall grass. Besieged by mines, booby traps, and sniper fire, the soldiers were pinned down, and the future of the new strategy hung in the balance‚Ä¶ \n\n- As images and footage of actual events are not always available, Dark Docs sometimes utilizes similar historical images and footage for dramatic effect.

Played to malevolent perfection by veteran Irish actor Patrick McGoohan, Edward is typically remembered as a tyrannical but brutally effective ruler. A more restrained portrayal of an aging ruler by Stephen Dillane can be seen in 2018's Outlaw King, but there have been no major portrayals of Edward's rule as a whole or of him in his prime.\n\nThe real Edward I was one of the most influential monarchs to ever take the English throne. His lengthy reign shaped the course of not only English history, but also Scottish and Welsh history for years to come. \n\nHe lived an eventful life full of adventure, intrigue, innovation, and savage cruelty against those who opposed him. This collection showcases some of the most interesting details of Edward's life that haven't been shown on screen.

Find them here: https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/ties/knit-tie-cognac-peach-charcoal-silk-fort-belvedere?utm_campaign=social-lead-gen&utm_medium=video&utm_source=youtube&utm_content=accept-compliments-like-a-gentleman&utm_term=youtube-description\n\n00:00 Introduction\n\nOnce you start dressing well, you'll notice that people will compliment you more often, it's a good thing. Don't spoil it!\n\nMost people don't know how to take a compliment and as a consequence, they alienate people or even offend them. Not only will they likely never compliment that person again but they may also avoid them or even speak badly about them.\n\nSo what started out as something positive turns into something negative, but it doesn't have to be that way. Responding and accepting a compliment is in fact so simple that everyone can do it without practice. \n\nHow Not To Reply To A Compliment\n\n01:11 First of all, don‚Äôt correct people\n01:31 Resist the urge to escape\n01:50 Denial\n02:11 Deflecting a compliment \n02:29 Don‚Äôt explain or over-explain\n02:54 Don‚Äôt brag\n03:13 Never cheapen a compliment\n03:30 Don‚Äôt forfeit\n\nHow Do You Accept A Compliment Like A Gentleman?\n\n04:00 Relax\n04:30 Observe and reciprocate\n04:50 Compliment their actions\n\nBottom line is, to accept a compliment only requires a smile and a ‚Äúthank you.‚Äù In order to give a great compliment back, you have to pay attention! So whenever you pay a compliment, it‚Äôs essential that it‚Äôs genuine. Otherwise, your body language and the way you say it will communicate that it‚Äôs not true, and then it really backfires on you.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, please sign up for our email list and give us a thumbs up and subscribe to our YouTube channel.

About eighty percent of these were .69-caliber smoothbores.\n\nThe Southern states possessed only about a third as many long guns ‚Äì many seized from federal arsenals.\n\nBoth sides could raise more troops than they could quickly arm, and there was a massive effort to build or buy as many guns as possible.  Eventually millions more muskets, rifles, carbines, and revolvers would be delivered to Union and Confederate soldiers between 1861 and 1865.\n\nThe Civil War would lead to dramatic advancements in the technical progress and historical record of the American firearm -- and would lead to the dawn of modern warfare.\n\nBECOME A \"FOUNDING FATHER\" ON OUR NEW PATREON PAGE - Join to find content you can't find anywhere else - Consider becoming a member and joining the history revolution!\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/LHFW\n\nüá∫üá∏üëïüéñÔ∏è** Find All Of Our Exclusive Patriotic & History-Oriented Merchandise Here - Every Sale Supports The Channel And Keeps Us \"On The Air\": \nhttps://teespring.com/stores/lionheart-filmworks\n\n‚òï If you appreciate our content and want to support us further, direct donations are always welcome at: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/lionheart\n \nPLEASE SUBSCRIBE, CLICK THE 'BELL' ICON FOR ALERTS ON NEW CONTENT - AND SHARE THIS VIDEO TO HELP US GROW AND KEEP HISTORY HAPPENING!\n\nhttp://www.lionheart-filmworks.com/store\nSome other videos you might like on our Channel:\n\n\"Civil War Uniforms of Blue & Grey - The Evolution\" Volume 1: https://youtu.be/n8MAlu2NEps\n\n\"Gettysburg: Darkest Days & Finest Hours\" Complete Civil War Docu-Drama: https://youtu.be/xaNGbe0ymkU\n\n400 Evolution of the United States Army Uniform:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3Q6RyDFAJI&t=21s\n\nCivil War - 1862 U.S. Army Musket Drill HD:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvFMzZ-mczE\n\nCivil War 1863 - Gettysburg July 1st - The Opening Attacks:  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpMfQdhXrow&t=2s\n\nCivil War 1863 - Gettysburg's Picketts Charge:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm6mXz57dG0&t=37s\n\n‚úàÔ∏èüöÅ‚≠ê *** ONE WAY YOU CAN SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL!

The reason I‚Äôm asking is because the biggest Atheist objection I get to the Kalam while evangelizing is that 1. Energy can create a universe (quantum fluctuations) and 2. Energy may be constant (infinite). Can you object to these claims thoughtfully?\n3. 10:18 [How can Jesus ‚Äúbecome‚Äù sin?] The Bible says that Jesus ‚Äúbecame sin who knew no sin‚Äù (2 Corinthians 5:21). You also mentioned it at times in your videos. How can Jesus become sin?\n4. 15:08 [About Jerome, Latin Vulgate, Changes] Around 400 A.D., what were the biggest changes in doctrine that Jerome introduced in his first Latin Vulgate translation of the Bible, and how did they differ from the original Gospel?\n5. 18:55 [What does ‚Äúimpure‚Äù mean in Ephesians?] What does Paul mean, specifically, by \"impure\" in Ephesians 5:5? I can't find anything at all that clearly defines this. I would love to know what Paul, as a Jew, meant exactly by this term. \n6. 25:23 [Advice while ‚ÄúWaiting on the Lord‚Äù] I'm currently in a season of \"waiting on the Lord\" to know what He wants me to do with my life. Any advice for someone in this season?\n7. 28:20 [Can Christians Serve in Government Roles?] Can a Christian be called to be a governing authority talked about in Romans 13:1 with all that such a role would demand? Does it conflict or contradict with Romans 12:17 onwards?\n8. 32:07 [What does Idolatry Look Like Today?] What would you say is modern day idolatry? I spend way more time on Christian YouTube channels and my phone than I do reading the Bible or praying. Do you get concerned that people may idolize you?\n9. 38:37 [About Unclean Food/Items] In Mark 7: 14-19, why does Jesus seem appalled that the Jews believe that touching or eating certain things could make them unclean, given Leviticus 5:2-6 and Leviticus 11? This concept came from God.\n10. 44:21 [Why Would God Give Multiple Wives?] It's often said that God does not affirm polygamy in the Old Testament, but 2 Samuel 12:8 seems to refute that. Why would God give multiple wives to David if he opposes polygamy?\n11. 51:05 [When Were the Angels Created?] Were angels created on day 1 (with the heavens and all the hosts in them? (Nehemiah 9-6) Genesis 1 is not as clear. Are the hosts the angels? \n12. 54:03 [How to Lovingly Correct Others] When discussing ‚Äúcorrecting each other‚Äù in Bible studies (eg. Galatians 6:1, Matthew 18: 15), people mostly focus on when/why we shouldn't admonish someone. What does loving and appropriate discipline look like?\n13. 59:33 [How do we Biblically Love Ourselves?] How can I love myself biblically? Any advice or Scripture? I feel like I hate myself sometimes.\n14. 1:04:54 [Help with Reaching Atheist Family Members] Most of my friends and family are atheists and don‚Äôt take any argument for God seriously. How can I reach them in a way that they will listen and start to take Christianity seriously?\n15. 1:06:38 [Biblical Thoughts about Birth Control] What is a biblical perspective on married believers using birth control or permanent measures (e.g. a vasectomy)? Heard some say no based on Genesis 38 and Psalm 139.\n16. 1:09:40 [Why did God Allow Satan into the Garden?] Why would a God who hates evil place evil incarnate (Satan) into the garden, when the world was still good and sinless, knowing it would lead to the corruption of humans?\n17. 1:12:39 [Does Judas have a Throne?] In Matthew 19: 28, Jesus told His twelve disciples that they will have twelve thrones of judgment to judge the twelve tribes in the future. Does Judas still have a throne?\n18. 1:16:17 [Why is Jesus Called ‚ÄúThe Rock‚Äù?] Why does God repeatedly declare that He is the only Savior in Isaiah? He says He knows of no rock. This was confusing because Jesus is said to be a rock.\n19. 1:17:54 [About the ‚ÄúNarrow Gate‚Äù (Matthew)] Can you explain to me what the ‚Äúnarrow gate‚Äù means in Matthew 7: 13-14 (what it means in practice)?\n20. 1:20:50 [Does 2 Consciousnesses = 2 Souls?] There have been cases of people that live with only half a brain. Does someone that has had the connection between the halves of their brain removed and now have two consciousnesses have two souls. \n\nHelping you learn to think biblically about everything.\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7tTRdde-sDk/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UC7u2HaYBKDaLPcWmldxgGEA","channelTitle":"Mike Winger","duration":"PT1H24M19S","viewCount":"70475","likeCount":"2176","commentCount":"513","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDxgiYVvHlB3sjvYeUqxO4Fj","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REeGdpWVZ2SGxCM3NqdlllVXF4TzRGai5GNjNDRDREMDQxOThCMDQ2","playlistPosition":1},{"videoId":"PcWeZS3cnNo","publishedAt":"2021-02-15T23:07:12Z","title":"What Ravi Did and Where We Go From Here.","description":"Lori Anne Thompson's full victim impact statement video - https://youtu.be/4kDe8caElaw \n\nVictims of Ravi can safely contact (or have someone they trust contact) Rachael Denhollander a former victim and advocate who will help them. Please don‚Äôt spam her with emails, this is for victims who need a safe person to take up their cause. mailto:rjd.requests@gmail.com\n\n\nThis is not a video I'm looking forward to. But this is why I'm doing it.\n1) Ravi's victims need vindication. In particular, Lori Anne Thompson has been continually maligned and horribly treated because she brought TRUE accusations against Ravi. I believed the worst about her because of the comments from Ravi and the echoes of those comments from RZIM. This only made her a continual victim. We need to clear her name.\n2) Ravi's sins have left a lot of open wounds that need tending. Both in the body of Christ and in RZIM. Believers need to be reminded of how to process all this as a follower of Christ, of how true Christ remains regardless of this tragedy and how to handle this situation so that we don't wrongly treat RZIM staff, Ravi's family or continue to make the error of ignoring red flags that may still lead to more discoveries. I've seen every kind of wrong response online already. I pray to God that I would have wisdom to help us all to have wisdom here. If you are reading this before I go live then please stop and pray for me as I prepare for this video.\n3) Scripture commands us to openly deal with a leader who persists in sin, which is proven by evidence, by telling the local body so that other leaders can properly fear their own falling (1 Tim 5:19-20). Since Ravi was a leader in worldwide Christianity with personal character endorsements from countless other leaders this command can only be fulfilled by taking the truth as public as his endorsements were.\n4) If we as the body of Christ do not deal with this issue openly then I feel that we implicate ourselves in some sort of complicity at this point. The witness of Christ in the world has been harmed by Ravi's sin and we do need to publicly deal with it. Due to my own place in ministry as a public figure I do feel compelled to speak on this.\n\nLike many of you I am angry and I'm sad. But we can't respond with conspiracy theories that deny the overwhelming evidence of persistent sin, abuse of power, abuse of ministry funds, abuse of women and how calculated and deliberate it all was. The facts are in, all that is left is to face them and try to respond in ways that honor Christ. \n\nTo Ravi's family, I'm really sorry I am making a video about your father/husband/relative. It breaks my heart and I hate the idea of adding hurt to what you are going through. Please know that I don't mean you harm and I'm not on the bandwagon of heartless crowds. I am compelled that this must be done and I pray that you will find, in some way, some help in it as well.\n\nThe PDF of the full Miller & Martin investigative report on Ravi https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/rzimmedia.rzim.org/assets/downloads/Report-of-Investigation.pdf\n\nThe board of RZIM's most recent statement (as of 2/15/2020) https://www.rzim.org/read/rzim-updates/board-statement\n\nThe timeline according to Brad and Lori - https://julieroys.com/open-letter-to-rzim-from-brad-lori-anne-thompson/\n\nChristianity Today Spa Article https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2020/september/ravi-zacharias-sexual-harassment-rzim-spa-massage-investiga.html\n\nWorld Magazine Spa Article https://world.wng.org/2020/10/new_sexual_misconduct_claims_surface_about_ravi_zacharias \n\nOpen Letter from Thompsons - https://julieroys.com/open-letter-to-rzim-from-brad-lori-anne-thompson/ 10-13-2020\n\nMy teaching explaining that all sin is NOT the same. https://youtu.be/Tp_lAMuX16k\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PcWeZS3cnNo/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UC7u2HaYBKDaLPcWmldxgGEA","channelTitle":"Mike Winger","duration":"PT1H49M36S","viewCount":"899098","likeCount":"22607","commentCount":"12903","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDxgiYVvHlB3sjvYeUqxO4Fj","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REeGdpWVZ2SGxCM3NqdlllVXF4TzRGai40NzZCMERDMjVEN0RFRThB","playlistPosition":2},{"videoId":"Yrk9NG8ZMFE","publishedAt":"2021-04-12T21:34:24Z","title":"Relearning The Last Supper: The Mark Series pt 59 (14:12-26)","description":"I remember the first time I read through this passage.

Chesterton, said that way back in 1911, long before math was considered racist and biological men were allowed to compete against women in sports. One can only imagine what he would say if he were alive today.\n\nAt¬†The Babylon Bee, where we write satire for a living, we're feeling Chesterton's pain in a big way. Just look at these headlines that were satirical at the time we wrote them‚Ä¶\n\nOn May 9, 2017, we ran this headline:¬†\n\n‚Äò2+2=4,‚Äô Insists Closed-Minded Bigot¬†\n\nThat was a joke, of course. But on August 10, 2020,¬†the Washington Examiner¬†published this story:¬†\n\nMath professor claims equation 2+2=4 'reeks of white supremacist patriarchy'\n\nOn August 13, 2020, we ran this headline:¬†\n\nBLM Rioters Awarded Nobel Peace Prize¬†\n\nAt the time we thought this was obvious satire, but on January 29, 2021, this story was published in¬†The Guardian:¬†\n\nBlack Lives Matter movement nominated for Nobel Peace Prize\n\nOn March 25, 2020, we ran this headline:¬†\n\nPants Sales Plummet As Everyone Working From Home¬†\n\nThe very next day, this story appeared in¬†Yahoo! Finance:¬†\n\nAmid coronavirus, Walmart says it's seeing increased sales of tops‚Äîbut not bottoms\n\nI could go on. Our satirical headlines are proving to be prophetic with astonishing regularity. So what does this mean for humor and satire? Well, for one thing, it makes our job much more difficult.\n\nYou might be surprised to hear that. The crazier reality is, the easier it is to make fun of, right? Actually, it's the opposite. Satire exaggerates the truth to make a point. But when reality is this absurd, and extreme views and behavior are commonplace, how do you go a step beyond it? Almost anything we publish now ends up being believable. And much of it ends up actually coming true, as you've just seen. This is exactly what Chesterton was talking about. It‚Äôs one of the ways the left is killing satire: by turning reality into a parody of itself.\n\nThere‚Äôs another, more intentional and insidious way the left is killing satire, and that‚Äôs through censorship. We published an article a couple of years ago with this over-the-top headline:¬†\n\nCNN Purchases Industrial-Sized Washing Machine To Spin News Before Publication¬†\n\nBelieve it or not, Snopes fact-checked this story. I mean, come on‚Ä¶a washing machine? To spin the news? That's an obvious joke. But Snopes fact-checked it and rated it \"false\"‚Äîas if we had written a serious story.¬†\n\nIt used to be that jokes were either funny or not‚Äîthey made you laugh, or they didn't‚Äîbut now, in the fact-checking age, we're giving them a truth rating. Jokes are no longer funny‚Äîthey're false.¬†And false information is dangerous. In response to the Snopes fact check, Facebook warned us that we'd be demonetized and de-platformed¬†if we continued publishing ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù It should go without saying that there's a big difference between fake news‚Äîwhich is meant to deceive‚Äîand satire, which is meant to entertain and inform through mockery, humor, and irony. But the left benefits by blurring this distinction. If they can successfully lump us in with fake news, then they can shut us down. It‚Äôs that simple.\n\nThese fact checks‚Äîwhich often smear us by suggesting we're purposefully misleading people‚Äîare nothing more than a creative, conniving way of justifying censorship. But why would anyone want to censor satire? Why is Facebook paying¬†USA Today¬†to write lengthy refutations of our jokes? (Yes, they actually do that.) Because humor is ultimately a vehicle for truth delivery, and the truth can be offensive. Think about all the things you're not allowed to say anymore‚Äînot because they're false, but because they make people uncomfortable. Satire cuts right through the pretense and political correctness to expose uncomfortable truths, and it does so more ruthlessly and effectively than anything else.\n\nFor the complete transcript visit https://www.prageru.com/video/killing-comedy","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ISHGeiXPh68/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UCZWlSUNDvCCS1hBiXV0zKcA","channelTitle":"PragerU","duration":"PT4M52S","viewCount":"1261962","likeCount":"21354","commentCount":"1831","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDwK9wca0UW4shViNd6-ti-7","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REd0s5d2NhMFVXNHNoVmlOZDYtdGktNy5DQUNERDQ2NkIzRUQxNTY1","playlistPosition":7},{"videoId":"_wbyqv_G8IE","publishedAt":"2021-01-12T23:02:16Z","title":"NPC University Season 3 Episode 36","description":"https://www.paypal.me/politicalcheese\nhttps://www.cheesytoons.com\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/politicalcheese","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_wbyqv_G8IE/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UC_voeHE6JFumgTW6juXnQXg","channelTitle":"ME ME MEME","duration":"PT2M21S","viewCount":"16699","likeCount":"1910","commentCount":"246","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDwK9wca0UW4shViNd6-ti-7","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REd0s5d2NhMFVXNHNoVmlOZDYtdGktNy45NDk1REZENzhEMzU5MDQz","playlistPosition":8},{"videoId":"AdOwZRFlXlQ","publishedAt":"2019-02-07T08:35:49Z","title":"My NPC Friend","description":"https://www.paypal.me/politicalcheese \nEvery small donation helps to keep the channel going.","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AdOwZRFlXlQ/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UC_voeHE6JFumgTW6juXnQXg","channelTitle":"ME ME MEME","duration":"PT4M30S","viewCount":"300664","likeCount":"22717","commentCount":"2098","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDwK9wca0UW4shViNd6-ti-7","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REd0s5d2NhMFVXNHNoVmlOZDYtdGktNy5GNjNDRDREMDQxOThCMDQ2","playlistPosition":9},{"videoId":"76NytvQAIs0","publishedAt":"2017-03-27T08:48:22Z","title":"Why Isn't There a Palestinian State?","description":"Why don't the Palestinians have their own country?

That‚Äôs what you hear from UN ambassadors, European diplomats and most college professors.\n\nBut what if I told you that Israel has already offered the Palestinians a state of their own - and not just once, but on five separate occasions?  \n\nDon‚Äôt believe me?\n\nLet‚Äôs review the record. \n\nAfter the breakup of the Ottoman Empire following World War I, Britain took control of most of the Middle East, including the area that constitutes modern Israel. \n\nSeventeen years later, in 1936, the Arabs rebelled against the British, and against their Jewish neighbors.\n\nThe British formed a task force ‚Äì the Peel Commission ‚Äì to study the cause of the rebellion. The commission concluded that the reason for the violence was that two peoples ‚Äì Jews and Arabs ‚Äì wanted to govern the same land. \n\nThe answer, the Peel Commission concluded, would be to create two independent states ‚Äì one for the Jews, and one for the Arabs. A two-state solution. The suggested split was heavily in favor of the Arabs. The British offered them 80 percent of the disputed territory; the Jews, the remaining 20 percent. Yet, despite the tiny size of their proposed state, the Jews voted to accept this offer. But the Arabs rejected it and resumed their violent rebellion. Rejection number one.\n\nTen years later, in 1947, the British asked the United Nations to find a new solution to the continuing tensions.  Like the Peel Commission, the UN decided that the best way to resolve the conflict was to divide the land. \n\nOn November 7, 1947, the UN voted to create two states. Again, the Jews accepted the offer. And again, the Arabs rejected it, only this time, they did so by launching an all-out war. Rejection number two.\n\nJordan, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon and Syria joined the conflict. But they failed. Israel won the war, and got on with the business of building a new nation. Most of the land set aside by the UN for an Arab state ‚Äì the West Bank and east Jerusalem ‚Äì became occupied territory; occupied not by Israel, but by Jordan.\n\nTwenty years later, in 1967, the Arabs, led this time by Egypt and joined by Syria and Jordan, once again sought to destroy the Jewish State. \n\nThe 1967 conflict, known as the Six Day War, ended in a stunning victory for Israel. Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as the area known as the Gaza Strip, fell into Israel‚Äôs hands. The government split over what to do with this new territory.  Half wanted to return the West Bank to Jordan and Gaza to Egypt in exchange for peace.  The other half wanted to give it to the region‚Äôs Arabs, who had begun referring to themselves as the Palestinians, in the hope that they would ultimately build their own state there.  \n\nNeither initiative got very far.  A few months later, the Arab League met in Sudan and issued its infamous ‚ÄúThree No‚Äôs:‚Äù No peace with Israel. No recognition of Israel. No negotiations with Israel. Again, a two-state solution was dismissed by the Arabs, making this rejection number three. \n\nFor the complete script, visit https://www.prageru.com/videos/why-isnt-there-palestinian-state","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/76NytvQAIs0/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UCZWlSUNDvCCS1hBiXV0zKcA","channelTitle":"PragerU","duration":"PT5M35S","viewCount":"3604839","likeCount":"104007","commentCount":"26682","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDwK9wca0UW4shViNd6-ti-7","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REd0s5d2NhMFVXNHNoVmlOZDYtdGktNy40NzZCMERDMjVEN0RFRThB","playlistPosition":10},{"videoId":"r-teJabFF90","publishedAt":"2021-02-12T18:00:28Z","title":"Sodom and Gomorrah: Biblical Archaeology","description":"Did the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah ever exist and were they ever destroyed by fire from the sky?

They create videos explaining the ideas of history's great thinkers in order to help supply the world with more knowledge, to empower the individual, and to promote freedom. Please check out their youtube channel for more brilliant content. https://www.youtube.com/c/academyofideas or visit their website to learn more https://academyofideas.com/\n\nIn this video we are going to explore the most dangerous of all psychic epidemics, the mass psychosis. A mass psychosis is an epidemic of madness and it occurs when a large portion of a society loses touch with reality and descends into delusions. Such a phenomenon is not a thing of fiction. Two examples of mass psychoses are the American and European witch hunts 16th and 17th centuries and the rise of totalitarianism in the 20th century.\n\nThis video will aim to answer questions surrounding mass psychosis: What is it? How does is start? Has it happened before? Are we experiencing one right now? And if so, how can the stages of a mass psychosis be reversed?\n\nThis video took a tremendous amount of work.

Two hospitals.¬†One private, the other public.¬†One¬†in Florida, the other in New York.\n\nAnd not just any New York public hospital, but the \"epicenter of the epicenter\" itself, the infamous Elmhurst in Donald Trump's Queens. As a result of these diametrically opposed experiences, she has the ultimate \"perspective on the pandemic\".¬†She has been where there have been the¬†most¬†deaths attributed to Covid-19 and where there have been the¬†least.\n\nErin enlisted in the Army when she was 17. She deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. Part of her duties involved overseeing aid disbursement and improvements to hospital facilities. While in country she received the Army Commendation Medal for meritorious service, and was wounded in combat. Erin eventually retired as a sergeant, and became a civilian nurse in 2012.\nErin is a medical freedom and informed consent advocate. She co-founded the Florida Freedom Alliance but no longer has any connection with the organization.\n\nWatch more episodes of Perspectives on the Pandemic here:\nEpisode 1: https://dai.ly/x7ubcws\nEpisode 2: https://dai.ly/k7af1wKOAvcoA7w5DkZ\nEpisode 3: https://youtu.be/VK0Wtjh3HVA\nEpisode 4: https://youtu.be/cwPqmLoZA4s\nEpisode 5: https://dai.ly/k3l3VyZ2YQv6Zbw5VqE\nEpisode 6: https://youtu.be/3f0VRtY9oTs\nEpisode 7: https://youtu.be/2JbOvjtnPpE\nEpisode 8: https://youtu.be/WlLmt6_w_AM\n\n(As of publication of this video, the producers are still awaiting comment from Elmhurst Hospital).\n\nProduced by Libby Handros and John Kirby, The Press and the Public Project.

But after being met at the airport by his brother Frank, Jack discovers that the country has radically changed. Citizens report and fine one another for various civil infractions, using their mobile phones to record and upload offenses to a government app.\n\nJack is in disbelief as he arrives at Frank's home with his wife Margaret, and he can't even believe that swearing is fined and alcohol is banned. There are cameras everywhere, and the only safe place in people's homes is the bathroom. Unable to adapt or accept the changes, Jack attempts to leave the country -- a much harder feat to accomplish than he thought.\n\nWritten and directed by Kosta Nikas, this sci-fi short may be named after an ideal paradise of balance and peace, but its title is deeply satirical in how the film portrays the absurdity of the new surveillance state. It constructs a fascinating world that seems only a few steps removed from our phone-saturated society, telling its cautionary tale in an ironically jaunty way.\n\nThe writing takes time in its world-building, which is often one of the pleasures of the sci-fi genre. The narrative action at the beginning catalogs the myriad ways that control and order are exerted over people, and there's dour, wry humor embedded in how Frank escorts his increasingly skeptical brother through this brave new world. The bright sunniness of the cinematography and the percolating, cheerful musical score that peppers itself throughout the film also add touches of stylish buoyancy to what is an increasingly dark story.\n\nThe aesthetic approach offers a counterpoint to the often horrifying reality shown on screen, in which citizens are incentivized to document one another's offenses through their omnipresent phones. Jack is a stand-in for the audience, looking increasingly askance at how even the most intimate recesses of everyday life can't escape the pitiless lens of a camera and the desperate people wielding them.\n\nIt takes some time for the dramatic conflict to emerge, but the world-building is fascinating enough to carry interest through, and is substantial and detailed enough to power an entire series or feature. By the time Jack finally decides that he must escape, the building blocks of the world and story have been carefully laid into place, forming a chain of obstacles that make it harder for him to leave. He seems trapped indefinitely, but then he gets an unexpected chance -- though one that comes at considerable cost.\n\nThat cost, however, doesn't seem so bad by the time we conclude \"Utopia,\" which we realize is anything but. Its sense of horror derives not from perversity or violence, but from how the world that the film constructs is only a few clicks from our current reality.\n\nPractically everyone has a smartphone, and the devices are deeply integrated with almost all aspects of our lives, from banking to romance to communication to entertainment. At many levels, we're still reckoning with how mobile technology is transforming our lives and our relationships. A population armed with phones -- and imbued with increasingly knee-jerk punitiveness towards fellow humans -- seems ludicrous, but with deeper reflection, viewers realize those pieces are already in place in other aspects of our culture. Are human beings so weak that they could be weaponized to do a government's surveillance for them? \"Utopia\" imagines that day isn't as far as one would think.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Thank you!\n\nThe Pennsbury School District is in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. It is governed by nine (9) elected public officials (all Democrats). Please read the links below. A recording of the full meeting is availale here if you would like to see all the public comments: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UgSMB4M70Y. A local news reporter write about the story here: http://levittownnow.com/2021/06/23/pennsbury-editing-some-public-comments-out-of-board-meeting-videos/.\n\nAs of June 18, 2021 Pennsbury had posted video of of its March 18, 2021 and May 20, 2021 school board meetings on its website and these tapes say \"edited due to content\" in places. See http://video.pennsburysd.org/ (May 20th meeting at 35m10s & 1hr40m00s). What has been cut from the posted tapes is public comment by citizens opposed to critical race theory.\n\nPennsbury's Director of Equity, Diversity & Education, Dr. Cherrissa Gibson, in an email dated March 20, 2021 at 2:20pm to Superintendent Gretzula and School Board President Toy-Dragoni, released under the Right-to-Know-Law, is seen promoting an agenda of censoring public comment with which she disagrees. Read for yourself the censorship agenda of Dr. Gibson: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vwVm0fYjfmLokGMTzmKSUqr3Z2ZK31hR/view\n\nRead the Pennsbury School Board President, Christine Toy-Dragoni, gleefully tell the public she will go along with the censorship agenda of Dr. Gibson: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wq4cYx5uRDwRhBPBP8xHjuTTzym_JmzC/view\n\nThe school solicitor who tried to shout down my public comment is solicitor Michael Clarke of the law firm Rudolph Clarke LLC: https://rudolphclarke.com/meet-our-attorneys/michael-p-clarke/\n\nA summary of the case law that I cited in my comments (1964's landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in New York Times v. Sullivan) can be read here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times_Co._v._Sullivan. My right to petition the Pennsbury School Board to terminate the employment of Dr. Gibson is a constitutionally protected Noerr-Pennington petitioning right under the First Amendment. See e.g. NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886, 914, 102 S.Ct. 3409, 73 L.Ed.2d 1215 (1982). https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7271075303659098319\n\nThe United States, as the Supreme Court noted in NY Times v. Sullivan, is founded on the \"profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.\" The Pennsbury School Board is not allowed to enact a public comment policy that supersedes a higher law and there is no higher law than the United States Constitution. These government officials at Pennsbury mistakenly believe that all power in inherent in the Government. They are wrong. In the United States of America all power in inherent in the People.\n\nIn Harrisburg, PA State Representative Russ Diamond, has introduced House Bill 1532 that would make it illegal to teach public school students much of what constitutes Critical Race Theory.

Every Republican president‚Äîfor that matter, virtually every Republican‚Äîsince the 1970s has been called a fascist; now, more than ever.\n\nThis label is based on the idea that fascism is a phenomenon of the political right. The left says it is, and some self-styled white supremacists and neo-Nazis embrace the label. \n\nBut are they correct?\n\nTo answer this question, we have to ask what fascism really means: What is its underlying ideology? Where does it even come from?\n\nThese are not easy questions to answer. We know the name of the philosopher of capitalism: Adam Smith. We know the name of the philosopher of Marxism: Karl Marx. But who‚Äôs the philosopher of fascism? \n\nYes‚Äîexactly. You don‚Äôt know. Don‚Äôt feel bad. Almost no one knows. This is not because he doesn‚Äôt exist, but because historians, most of whom are on the political left, had to erase him from history in order to avoid confronting fascism‚Äôs actual beliefs. So, let me introduce him to you. His name is Giovanni Gentile. \n\nBorn in 1875, he was one of the world‚Äôs most influential philosophers in the first half of the twentieth century. Gentile believed that there were two ‚Äúdiametrically opposed‚Äù types of democracy. One is liberal democracy, such as that of the United States, which Gentile dismisses as individualistic‚Äîtoo centered on liberty and personal rights‚Äîand therefore selfish. The other, the one Gentile recommends, is ‚Äútrue democracy,‚Äù in which individuals willingly subordinate themselves to the state.\n\nLike his philosophical mentor, Karl Marx, Gentile wanted to create a community that resembles the family, a community where we are ‚Äúall in this together.‚Äù It‚Äôs easy to see the attraction of this idea. Indeed, it remains a common rhetorical theme of the left.\n\nFor example, at the 1984 convention of the Democratic Party, the governor of New York, Mario Cuomo, likened America to an extended family where, through the government, people all take care of each other. \n\nNothing‚Äôs changed. Thirty years later, a slogan of the 2012 Democratic Party convention was, ‚ÄúThe government is the only thing we all belong to.‚Äù They might as well have been quoting Gentile.\n\nNow, remember, Gentile was a man of the left. He was a committed socialist. For Gentile, fascism is a form of socialism‚Äîindeed, its most workable form. While the socialism of Marx mobilizes people on the basis of class, fascism mobilizes people by appealing to their national identity as well as their class. Fascists are socialists with a national identity. German Fascists in the 1930s were called Nazis‚Äîbasically a contraction of the term ‚Äúnational socialist.‚Äù\n \nFor Gentile, all private action should be oriented to serve society; there is no distinction between the private interest and the public interest. Correctly understood, the two are identical. And who is the administrative arm of the society? It‚Äôs none other than the state. Consequently, to submit to society is to submit to the state‚Äînot just in economic matters, but in all matters. Since everything is political, the state gets to tell everyone how to think and what to do. \n\n\nFor the complete script, visit https://www.prageru.com/videos/fascism-right-or-left","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m6bSsaVL6gA/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UCZWlSUNDvCCS1hBiXV0zKcA","channelTitle":"PragerU","duration":"PT5M38S","viewCount":"2159284","likeCount":"93026","commentCount":"17842","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDwK9wca0UW4shViNd6-ti-7","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REd0s5d2NhMFVXNHNoVmlOZDYtdGktNy4wMDkwRkI3NzExODA2MTFG","playlistPosition":110},{"videoId":"DkblZPi9_7Y","publishedAt":"2022-10-14T19:00:09Z","title":"Amir Tsarfati: Removed Before Wrath","description":"For those who believe in the reality of the rapture - the catching away of the church to be with Christ forever - the disagreement doesn't concern what, but when. Is the wrath¬†of God just a general term, or is it a specific period of time? Are believers appointed to experience at least a portion of God's wrath? How is your understanding of the character of God impacted based on what you believe about the future? Join Amir on a tour from Genesis to Revelation as he makes a scripturally-based case for the pre-tribulation¬†rapture of the church.\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://buff.ly/36cDNpo\n\nFollow us on social media:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/beholdisrael/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/beholdisrael/\nTelegram: https://t.me/beholdisraelchannel\n\nVisit our website: https://beholdisrael.org\nPublic Reading of Scripture: http://beholdprs.org\nOrder Amir‚Äôs new book \"Operation Joktan\": shop.beholdisrael.org\nDVD‚Äôs & Digital Downloads: https://shop.beholdisrael.org\n\nLatest Middle East News: https://beholdisrael.org/news/\nBible Teachings: https://beholdisrael.org/watch-and-listen/bible-teachings/\nArticles: https://beholdisrael.org/articles/\nTeaching Around the World: https://beholdisrael.org/teaching-around-the-world/\nBible Experience Tours: https://beholdisrael.org/bible-experience-tours/","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DkblZPi9_7Y/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UCa3C7WpFobavsDJdkKUtodw","channelTitle":"Behold Israel with Amir Tsarfati","duration":"PT1H6M46S","viewCount":"241485","likeCount":"10554","commentCount":"1469","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDwK9wca0UW4shViNd6-ti-7","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REd0s5d2NhMFVXNHNoVmlOZDYtdGktNy4xRDJGOTc4RkUxMzUwMUFG","playlistPosition":111}]},{"playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDw6hkxD0HMeRN2fCI2chovL","title":"üìÄ Documentaries","description":"","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nQuwTdrVrg4/mqdefault.jpg","itemCount":37,"newItemCount":0,"videos":[{"videoId":"nQuwTdrVrg4","publishedAt":"2020-07-31T18:14:44Z","title":"Kill Chain: The Cyber War on America‚Äôs Elections | Full Documentary for DEF CON | HBO","description":"In advance of the 2020 U.S. Presidential election, Kill Chain: The Cyber War on America‚Äôs Elections takes a deep dive into the weaknesses of today‚Äôs election technology, investigating the startling vulnerabilities in America‚Äôs voting systems and the alarming risks they pose to our democracy.

And while the mystery surrounding the virus's origin remains, much is learned about the CCP's cover-up that led to the pandemic and the threat it poses to the world.\n\nEditor‚Äôs note on update to documentary\n\nFrom the start of the virus outbreak in China, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has not been forthcoming with information about the virus. In the early days of the outbreak, medical professionals who sounded the alarm were reprimanded by police for spreading \"rumors.\"\n\nInitially, the CCP said the virus originated at the Huanan Seafood Market, even though it knew patient zero had no connection with the market. Fearing that it might be held accountable for the worldwide pandemic, the CCP shifted its narrative to suggest that the virus originated in the United States and was brought to China by the U.S. military.\n\nAs a leading voice in covering China for the past 20 years, we understand very well the CCP's deceptive nature and its history of cover-ups. With this outbreak, we saw a case of history repeating itself‚Äîin 2003, we exposed the CCP's cover-up of the SARS epidemic in China, far ahead of other media.\n\nIn this documentary, we present viewers with the known scientific data and facts surrounding the origin of the virus along with experts‚Äô opinions. We don't draw conclusions, but we point out that serious questions remain about the origins of the virus as well as the CCP's handling of the outbreak.\n\nSome of our viewers felt the #documentary was taking a position on the origin of the virus, which was not our intent. The documentary has been slightly updated as of April 14 to better reflect our position, which is not to provide a definitive answer, but rather to present the known facts.\n\n#wuhan #VirusOrigin\n\n------------------\nSign the Petition to Investigate, Condemn, and Reject the Chinese Communist Party\n‚ñ∂Ô∏èhttps://ccpvirustruth.com\n\n------------------\nBUY US A COFFEE ‚òï \nWe're working day and night to cover the CCP virus outbreak for you.\nDonating as little as the amount of a cup of coffee will help keep our media going.\nhttps://ept.ms/coffee\n\nSUBSCRIBE OUR CHANNEL TODAY: \nhttps://bit.ly/EpochSubs\n\nFollow us on Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/epochtimes/\n\nWATCH MORE ON YOUTUBE\n\nüîµA Conscientious Declaration from China Disband the CCP | The Epoch Times\nhttps://bit.ly/39zh9Zf\n\nüîµ Spain: 70% Of China's Virus-Testing Kits Are Faulty | The Epoch Times\nhttps://bit.ly/2UUbdVh\n\n------------------\nGet the latest updates as well as exclusive reporting and first-hand videos about the CCP virus from The Epoch Times website.\n‚ñ∂Ô∏è https://www.theepochtimes.com/ccp-virus","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XMJ0EmMfb3U/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UCeLc4heXqG9dtL7jiPHMBfQ","channelTitle":"The Epoch Times","duration":"PT54M8S","viewCount":"1365261","likeCount":"26682","commentCount":"3986","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDw6hkxD0HMeRN2fCI2chovL","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REdzZoa3hEMEhNZVJOMmZDSTJjaG92TC4zMDg5MkQ5MEVDMEM1NTg2","playlistPosition":12},{"videoId":"MZ74NhEUY-w","publishedAt":"2020-06-29T00:00:09Z","title":"(‰∏≠ÊñáÂ≠óÂπïÔºâThe Coverup of the Century | Zooming In‚Äôs one-hour documentary movie | ZOOMING IN SPECIAL","description":"Zooming In‚Äôs one-hour documentary movie follows investigative reporter Simone Gao‚Äôs inquiry into critical questions about the pandemic: What did the Chinese Communist leadership do at the early stages of the outbreak?

You can buy, download and watch over 70 more lectures like this at: \n‚òûhttps://bit.ly/2WsUHx1\n\nDr. Kurt Wise explored the impact of the global flood on the earth in a series of three in-depth lectures. This lecture on the ‚Äúgeophysics of the flood,‚Äù the third in the series, provides a fascinating look at the processes behind the global flood. The question of how a global Flood could happen is an important area of research for modern creation scientists. One of the theories used to explain this process was developed by a number of scientists featured in the film. It is known as ‚ÄúCatastrophic Plate Tectonics‚Äù and has a great deal of explanatory power concerning the geophysical processes behind the global catastrophe.\n\nDr. Wise earned his BA in geology from the University of Chicago, and his MA and PhD degrees in paleontology from Harvard University. He founded and directed the Center for Origins Research at Bryan College and taught biology there for 17 years. He then led the Center for Theology and Science at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary for 3 years, before founding and directing the Center for Creation Research and teaching biology at Truett McConnell University for the last 7 years. His fieldwork has included research in early Flood rocks in the Death Valley region, late Flood rocks in Wyoming, and post-Flood caves in Tennessee.\n\nFor more information on Dr. Kurt Wise, please go to https://bit.ly/2zUN3U9.\n‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì\n‚ú® Looking to learn more about Genesis and Creation?\n\nü¶ï Visit our blog for helpful articles: https://bit.ly/3d306R1\nüçÉ Free Videos: https://bit.ly/3e1HRgc\nüåå Questions & Answers: https://bit.ly/3d0EG6T","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n2ANUKSF2BE/mqdefault.jpg","channelId":"UCzjPwFPxtpZTJ1dq7cAkb3g","channelTitle":"Is Genesis History?","duration":"PT2H11M42S","viewCount":"724600","likeCount":"9468","commentCount":"3598","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDw6hkxD0HMeRN2fCI2chovL","playlistItemId":"UExMRko2bTYwQ3REdzZoa3hEMEhNZVJOMmZDSTJjaG92TC45RTgxNDRBMzUwRjQ0MDhC","playlistPosition":17},{"videoId":"2ikjbUVEdyM","publishedAt":"2017-02-04T22:44:51Z","title":"George L.

But what did Freemasons President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his Masonic Vice President, Henry Wallace, believe when they attached this symbol to our currency in 1935?\n\nHow were these American leaders influenced by the Russian mystic, Nicholas Roerich? Does the all-seeing eye represent the Masonic Christ? Was the eagle originally a phoenix bird? And what do all these occult symbols mean?\n\nFollow the journey of the Secret Mysteries series as we unveil their influence through the 20th century.

The investigation that took place in the subsequent days and months revealed this case (which, though the creatures described were silver, gave rise to the term \"little green men\") to be one of the strangest purported encounters with extraterrestrials ever recorded.

This documentary takes the audience on a near 50-year journey both Dr. Burzynski and his patients have been enduring in order to obtain FDA-approved clinical trials of Antineoplastons. Defying the face of skepticism, legal attacks from state and federal agencies, and a powerful propaganda campaign to stop Burzynski ‚Äì this doctor and his patients are still going strong.\n\nDue to the continued failed efforts of state and federal agencies in their attempts to stop Burzynski from continuing to treat patients and expand his research, special interest groups have since launched a relentless propaganda campaign against Dr. Burzynski, and his supporters and patients, in hopes  that this game-changing innovation never reach the open market.\n\nThe primary reason that the cancer industry and its regulatory agencies fear the approval of Antineoplastons is purely economical.\n\nIf Antineoplastons were FDA-approved for just one cancer type this would mean that anyone of any age diagnosed with any type of cancer could legally insist their oncologist provide them with Antineoplastons ‚Äúoff-label‚Äù.   Given the gentle and nontoxic nature of these medications, most people would begin to opt for Antineoplastons as a first line of defense against their cancer instead of first choosing life-threatening yet profitable chemotherapy and radiation.\n\nBurzynski: The Cancer Cure Cover-up investigates this hidden cancer treatment and the decades of failed lawsuits the US government and FDA have pursued in order to try to silence him.\n\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨\n\nSubscribe Free Documentary Channel for free: https://bit.ly/2YJ4XzQ\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\n\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨\n#FreeDocumentary #Documentary #CancerCure\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨\n\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bringing high-class documentaries to you on YouTube for free.

This documentary tells the history of taxation, from the French Revolution to political protest movements like France‚Äôs \"Gilets Jaunes‚Äù.\n\nPart 1: https://youtu.be/ashglZx5yaU\n\nIs taxation an instrument serving the powerful, or a way to more fairly distribute wealth among the people? Part Two of the documentary looks at the history of citizen protests against \"those at the top\", as well as demands for taxation justice.\n\nAfter the 2008 financial crisis and the austerity policies that followed, voices of protest were heard all over Europe: whether from Brexit supporters in the United Kingdom, the \"Gilets Jaunes‚Äù (or \"yellow vests‚Äù) in France, or those disadvantaged by German reunification. These protests highlight a growing mistrust on the part of citizens toward their governments, and tax policy is often a bone of contention.\n\nSince the American Revolution with its rallying cry of \"No taxation without representation\", taxation and popular sovereignty have been mutually dependent. Current protests are a reminder to those in power of this basic rule of democracy. Meanwhile, the protests themselves hark back to turbulent moments in history: Since the Middle Ages, taxation has led to repeated conflicts between Europeans and their rulers. This two-part documentary follows the trail of these conflicts.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.
