Deputy Willmont learned the suspicious vehicle had been reported stolen and called for assistance. Once on scene, the deputies contacted the suspect, who was sitting in the driver‚Äôs seat of the stolen vehicle, a brown Kia Sportage SUV. The deputies announced themselves and attempted to obtain the suspect‚Äôs voluntary surrender, but the suspect failed to comply with the deputies‚Äô commands to show both of his hands. \n\nThe suspect then placed the stolen vehicle into reverse and hit the patrol vehicle where Deputy Willmont was positioned. As the stolen vehicle reversed, Deputy Foley deployed his taser through the driver‚Äôs side window and Deputy Willmont fired his agency-issued rifle through the rear window of the stolen vehicle. The suspect then placed the vehicle into drive. Once the vehicle came to a stop, the deputies removed the suspect, secured him and rendered emergency aid after determining he had suffered a single gunshot wound to the back. Deputies requested fire rescue and advanced life support resources but the suspect, 30-year-old Jamarian McGhee, was pronounced dead at the scene. A weapon was also recovered from the suspect.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nSpecial thanks to Shout-Out Supporters on Patreon:\n- Jacob\n- 'gorey hole'\n- Gianni M.\n- Charles Cooper\n- Joe\n- Cooper Malley\n- Luis Perez\n- Chris Wesley\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity","thumbnail":"https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/vgCVHdFnj54/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"26032","thumbCount":"2373"},{"id":"qB3n9anQ7GM","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UCXMYxKMh3prxnM_4kYZuB3g","channelName":"PoliceActivity","title":"Mesa Officer Shoots Suspect Who Drove Into Pizzeria To Avoid Police","published":"2022-10-21T16:23:30+00:00","updated":"2022-10-21T16:59:21+00:00","authorName":"PoliceActivity","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXMYxKMh3prxnM_4kYZuB3g","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qB3n9anQ7GM","description":"* (Disclaimer: This video content is intended for educational and informational purposes only) *\nMesa, Arizona ‚Äî On August 21, 2022, Mesa police officers were called to assist the Department of Public Safety with locating a wanted fugitive,  36-year-old Kevin McKinney out of Albuquerque, New Mexico. McKinney was wanted for a homicide that occurred in Albuquerque, on August 20, 2022. McKinney also had a probation violation warrant in Colorado. Albuquerque Police believe that McKinney was in Mesa, based off of cell phone records which showed him in the area of Dobson and Baseline roads. His vehicle was described as a black 2011 Jeep Patriot, equipped with multiple spotlights and red and blue lights inside to mimic a police car. Just after 3:30 PM detectives spotted McKinney's vehicle parked outside of a pizzeria on Dobson and Baseline Road. Detectives confirmed that McKinney was sitting inside a cell phone store next to the pizzeria. \n\nMcKinney left the wireless store and got into the driver's seat of his vehicle, that's what Mesa police officers positioned one of their vehicles at the back of McKinney's to contain him. Officers shouted for McKinney to exit the vehicle with his hands up. McKinney tried to back up into the police vehicle and that's when officers fired Les lethal beanbag rounds at his vehicle. McKinney quickly put his car in drive and drove forward, accelerating into the pizza restaurant. That is when multiple officers shot their Duty weapons. A surveillance video from inside the restaurant shows the vehicle breaking through the front door as three employees and one customer were inside. At the time, none of them were injured. McKinney stopped moving his vehicle and after a short time exited his vehicle. He was taken to the hospital and treated for gunshot wounds. Kevin McKinney faces multiple charges. A revolver and knives were recovered from McKinney's vehicle.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nSpecial thanks to Shout-Out Supporters on Patreon:\n- Jacob\n- 'gorey hole'\n- Gianni M.\n- Charles Cooper\n- Joe\n- Cooper Malley\n- Luis Perez\n- Chris Wesley\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity","thumbnail":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/qB3n9anQ7GM/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"102957","thumbCount":"6098"},{"id":"U7ya_rN-TfI","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UCkQO3QsgTpNTsOw6ujimT5Q","channelName":"BE AMAZED","title":"The Power Of Time - Part 5","published":"2022-10-21T18:00:12+00:00","updated":"2022-10-21T18:00:13+00:00","authorName":"BE AMAZED","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkQO3QsgTpNTsOw6ujimT5Q","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7ya_rN-TfI","description":"BEHOLD the power of time! \nSuggest a topic here to be turned into a video: http://bit.ly/2kwqhuh\nSubscribe for more! ‚ñ∫ https://goo.gl/pgcoq1 ‚óÑ\nStay updated ‚ñ∫ https://goo.gl/JyGcTt https://goo.gl/5c8dzr ‚óÑ \nFor copyright queries or general inquiries please get in touch: hello@beamazed.com\n\nLegal Stuff.\nUnless otherwise created by BeAmazed, licenses have been obtained for images/footage in the video from the following sources: https://pastebin.com/sDha7AGa","thumbnail":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/U7ya_rN-TfI/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"13755","thumbCount":"1274"},{"id":"IpYSkLkU2uI","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UCzUV5283-l5c0oKRtyenj6Q","channelName":"Mark Dice","title":"Hockey's New Ridiculous Plan for White PeopIe in the Sport üòÇ","published":"2022-10-21T12:00:13+00:00","updated":"2022-10-21T12:00:15+00:00","authorName":"Mark Dice","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzUV5283-l5c0oKRtyenj6Q","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpYSkLkU2uI","description":"üö®  Order my shirts here ‚û°Ô∏è  https://MarkDice.shop\n\nSubscribe to my channel for more great content!  https://YouTube.com/MarkDice?sub_confirmation=1\n\nA new report about diversity in Hockey has been released, and details the NHL's plans to help change things in the sport.  \n\nSupport Mark's work with a paid subscription: https://Youtube.com/MarkDice/join \n\nüé•  Support me through Patreon for $10 bucks a month:  https://Patreon.com/MarkDice \n\nOrder my book \"Hollywood Propaganda: How TV, Movies, and Music Shape Our Culture\" from Amazon: https://amzn.to/30xPFl5 or download the e-book from Kindle, iBooks, Google Play, or Nook.\n\nüìñ  Order my book, \"The True Story of Fake News\" ‚û°Ô∏è  https://amzn.to/2Zb1Vps   \n\nüìñ  Order my book \"The Liberal Media Industrial Complex\" here: https://amzn.to/2X5oGKx   \n\n‚¨úÔ∏è‚¨úÔ∏è‚¨úÔ∏è‚¨úÔ∏è‚¨úÔ∏è‚¨úÔ∏è‚¨úÔ∏è \n\n‚ö†Ô∏è  Order your \"F*ck Joe Biden\" shirt here: https://www.markdice.shop/listing/F-JoeBiden\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è   Order your \"Operation Mockingbird\" shirt here: https://www.markdice.shop/listing/OperationMockingbird \n\n‚ö†Ô∏è   Order your Warning: Contains Facts & Opinions Some May Find Offensive shirt here: https://www.markdice.shop/listing/TriggerWarning\n\n‚¨úÔ∏è‚¨úÔ∏è‚¨úÔ∏è‚¨úÔ∏è‚¨úÔ∏è‚¨úÔ∏è‚¨úÔ∏è\n\nMark Dice is an independent media analyst and bestselling author of \"Hollywood Propaganda: How TV, Movies, and Music Shape Our Culture.‚Äù  He has a bachelor's degree in Communication from California State University and was the first conservative YouTuber to reach 1 million subscribers (in 2017).    \n\nHe has been featured on Fox News, the History Channel, E!

This documentary presents the history of taxation, from the French Revolution to political protest movements like France‚Äôs \"Gilets Jaunes‚Äù.\n\nTaxation has always been a topic of fierce political debate. After the 2008 financial crisis and the austerity policies that followed, voices of protest were heard all over Europe: whether from Brexit supporters in the United Kingdom, the \"Gilets Jaunes‚Äù (or \"yellow vests‚Äù) in France, or those disadvantaged by German reunification. These protests highlight a growing mistrust of citizens toward their governments. Tax policy, it turns out, is often a bone of contention.\n\nSince the American Revolution, with its rallying cry of \"No taxation without representation\", taxation and popular sovereignty have been mutually dependent. Current protests are a reminder to those in power of this basic rule of democracy. Meanwhile, the protests themselves hark back to turbulent moments in history: Since the Middle Ages, taxation has led to repeated conflicts between Europeans and their rulers. This two-part documentary follows the trail of these conflicts.\n\nPart 2 will be published next week.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #taxes #taxation \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

A similar shift in mindset has happened across every dimension of human progress, leaving people feeling resentful rather than grateful.\n\nWatch Kibbe on Liberty on BlazeTV: https://blazetv.com/kibbe\nFollow Kibbe on Liberty on Facebook: https://facebook.com/KibbeBlazeTV\nFollow Free the People on YouTube: https://youtube.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Twitter: https://twitter.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Instagram: https://instagram.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Facebook: https://facebook.com/freethepeople\nVisit Free the People's Website: https://freethepeople.org\n\nKibbe on Liberty is a weekly podcast with libertarian author, economist, and community organizer Matt Kibbe. As the president of Free the People, Kibbe has decades of experience in the libertarian political sphere, but in these troubled times he believes that open dialogue is needed to bring people together. This means being willing to talk, and especially listen, to those with whom we might not always agree, trying to understand perspectives that might otherwise be foreign to us.\n\nKibbe on Liberty's growing roster of guests includes politicians, economists, comedians, writers, radio personalities, activists, journalists, and even a magician or two‚Äîwith topics of conversation ranging from current affairs to craft beer and the Grateful Dead. So grab a cold one, and settle in for the next hour of Kibbe on Liberty, mostly honest conversations with mostly interesting people.","thumbnail":"https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/vkJGDJD47Lc/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"25","thumbCount":"5"},{"id":"BL6_H2KBgd0","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UCdeMVChrumySxV9N1w0Au-w","channelName":"The Duran","title":"Russia prepares for next phase.
