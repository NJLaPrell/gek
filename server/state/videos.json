Neal) believed to be in possession of a firearm. Neal had two guns in the car with him. One was underneath of him. Decatur police said, that is the one he reached for before opening fire on the officers, shooting and wounding two of the officers. One video shows Decatur Police Sgt. Timothy Wittmer's hair being ruffled by a passing bullet and the officer falling to the ground as he is hit multiple times. His semi-automatic service pistol jams as he lays on the rain-soaked pavement and he quickly clears it before opening fire and appearing to empty his magazine at Neal who collapses, his body twitching with bullet impacts. \n\nFour police officers had returned fire at Neal: three Decatur officers and Macon County Sheriff's Deputy Travis Wolfe. During the incident, officers returned fire, shooting Neal. Neal was struck multiple times. Neal later died at a local hospital. Sgt. Wittmer was shot multiple times during this incident. He was shot in the hand which required surgery. He was also shot in the foot and the left posterior area, but a titanium wallet stopped that bullet. He had fragment injuries on his head. Officer Bowman was shot one time in the lower abdomen during this incident. It was a \"through and through\" wound. Both Sgt. Wittmer and Ofc. Bowman have been released from the hospital and are recovering. They remain on leave while the fatal shooting is investigated by the Illinois State Police, which is standard procedure.  \n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nSpecial thanks to Shout-Out Supporters on Patreon:\n- Rob Winton\n- 'The Chocolate Thief'\n- 'Jacob from Wisconi'\n- 'gorey hole'\n- Gianni M.\n- Charles Cooper\n- Joe\n- Cooper Malley\n- Luis Perez\n- Chris Wesley\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 - Dashcam: Officer Austin Bowman\n1:22 - Bodycam: Sgt.

And the University of Wisconsin-Madison denounces my event, despite having approved it weeks ago. Plus, the Biden Administration sends troops to Ukraine, even though we were told there would be no boots on the ground.

Theirs was a long history which dated back to the founding of Numenor. In these early days of the second age, the high men which forged a realm atop the Isle of Elena were led by a line of Kings. Such rulers had at their side not only a council to provide wisdom but also a guard to see to their safety. Part of this responsibility was extended to the White Tree of Numenor which stood as a symbol of the realm. \n\nFollowing the Fall of Numenor, the tradition of the Guard would be continued by the line of Numenoreans who escaped to establish the Kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor in Middle Earth. We trace their long history through the Second Age and into the Third Age which climaxed with the War of the Ring. We cover the equipment, organization, and service history of the Fountain Guard throughout this long period. In this way do we also cover the History of Gondor from the reign of the Kings, to the line of Stewards, and finally the Return of the King. We cover the various wars with Morder, the Easterlings, and Umbar with such conflicts as The Battle of Gladden Fields, The Battle of Pelennor Fields, and the Siege of Minas Tirith.\n\nWhat Units of Middle Earth would you like to see us cover next?\n\nIf you haven't already, check out our History of Middle Earth video which serves as a primer for lord of the rings lore from creation to the second age.\n\nCredits:\nResearch = Invicta\nScript = Invicta\nNarration = Edward Gil\nMaps = L'Arpenteur Cartography\nArtwork = Penta Limited\n\n#documentary \n#lordoftherings \n#ringsofpower","thumbnail":"https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/3VwJ8Y3ulP0/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"40231","thumbCount":"2462"},{"id":"h8cqkxJ_mLA","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UC0eAUMow8l6cLXjjTnF6dIw","channelName":"J Wilderness","title":"What's Going On?

rift between the political camps in the US remains deep. Now midterm elections are around the corner. The Republican Party is confident, while the Democrats fear they'll lose ground ‚Äì including in Wisconsin.\n\nTwo years ago, Joe Biden won the presidential election - now voters are giving him and his Democratic Party an interim report card. In the midterms on November 8, a new House of Representatives will be elected, along with one-third of the Senate. In the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin the political wind have shifted of late. Many voters there have grown disenchanted with President Biden's policies. That's also true for Milwaukee's Black community, which played a decisive role in the outcome of the 2020 elections. That's why campaign managers of both parties have ramped up their efforts to win over the city's African American voters. A report by Sumi Somaskanda.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #midterms2022 #blackcommunity \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

He tries flamenco dancing, tours the Alhambra, and finds his dream house on the Costa del Sol. In Tarifa, photographer Jos√© Luis Terrado shows Jaafar his photographs of refugees.\n\nFlamenco music has its roots in the south of Spain. In Las Negras, journalist Jaafar Abdul Karim meets up with flamenco performer Anabel Veloso for a dance. His Mediterranean journey then takes him into the interior of Andalusia. Throughout its history, the region has been a gateway to the Arabic-speaking world. More than 700 years of Islamic rule have left their mark, especially on the architecture. In Granada, Jaafar visits the famous Alhambra, a world heritage site.\n\nBack on the shores of the Mediterranean, the journey continues past beautiful beaches and picturesque bays to the city of M√°laga. It‚Äôs located on the \"Costa del Sol\", where the sun shines more than 300 days per year. The climate attracts millions of tourists, especially from Germany and Britain. Many have bought property here. In Estepona, Jaafar finds his dream home: the architects Jos√© Carlos Moya and Bertrand Coue have built a solar house with floor-to-ceiling windows and 360-degree panoramic views. Its unique design allows it to follow the trajectory of the sun, all day long. \n\nFinally, Jaafar heads to Tarifa, just 14 kilometers across the sea from Morocco. The proximity to the North African side of the Mediterranean has inspired the work of photographer Jos√© Luis Terrado. His pictures depict migration and the conditions under which refugees from Africa have to work in order to survive. More than any other destination on his Mediterranean journey, Andalusia shows Jaafar Abdul Karim just how closely linked Europe and Africa are, culturally as well as economically.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #andalusia #spain #mediterranean\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The nation is sinking deeper into crisis, with many people‚Äôs daily lives marred by shortages of food, medicine and electricity.\n\nCuba has been subject to sanctions for decades. Despite recent attempts at reform, the country is increasingly isolated and economically dependent. A currency reform enacted in 2021 is also causing major problems, with inflation soaring and prices skyrocketing. Food is scarce, and lines in front of the few state-run stores are getting longer and longer. \n\nPoverty is on the rise. Even the famous ingenuity of the Cuban people is reaching its limits as they try to cope with the day-to-day effects of the crisis. Images of bygone revolutionaries are fading in the streets the capital, Havana, and all over the island. Official voices continue to broadcast the state‚Äôs ideology, but ordinary people are losing hope that things will improve.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #cuba \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

It has become known for scary movies, candy, costumes and mischief. But there is a deep, universal tradition behind Halloween, also known as the Festival of the Dead, All Souls Day or Feast of the Ancestors. This festival is observed around the world, in the northern and southern hemispheres at the SAME time of year. In this video, we take a dive down the rabbit hole with Randall Carlson to uncover the mysterious origin of Halloween. \n\nRandall Carlson is a master builder and designer, a geologist, anthropologist and historian.

Russian forces were partially enveloped cutting off resupply but not retreat. Unfortunately, most of the Ukrainian forces involved have to move on foot so the Russians were able to make a new defensive line at the Oskil river and reservoir before the Ukrainian Army could seal off avenues of retreat and clear all the pockets of Russians caught behind UA lines.

Do you think their views are rooted in racism, ignorance, and intolerance? Or is it just possible that they have valid reasons for thinking the way they do? Former leftist activist and now PragerU personality Amala Ekpunobi breaks it down in PragerU‚Äôs 500th 5-Minute Video.\n\nIf you've enjoyed our 500 5-Minute Videos, please consider joining PragerU's Club5 with a donation of $5/month and help save America by contributing to our next wave of mind-changing videos: https://l.prageru.com/3eU419W\n\n#conservative #prageru #amalaekpunobi \n\nSUBSCRIBE üëâ https://www.prageru.com/join\n\nScript:\n\nWhy do you hate conservatives? Well let‚Äôs not say hate. Let‚Äôs say dislike, because you don‚Äôt really hate anyone.\n\nYou may dislike them because they want to ban abortion. Conservatives say they‚Äôre all for freedom, but when it comes to a woman‚Äôs freedom to choose what she wants to do with her own body, they sing a different tune.\n\nYou may dislike them because they oppress people of color and deny the fact that America is systemically racist. Conservatives say that everybody is equal regardless of race, and that racism has little to no effect on the daily lives of people of color. So they just ignore the issue altogether.\n\nYou may dislike them because they don‚Äôt believe in climate change. Scientists keep telling us we‚Äôre overheating the planet and conservatives don‚Äôt seem to care. They‚Äôre more concerned about profits than people. But what good is money if you have no planet to spend it on?\n\nYou may dislike them because they‚Äôre obsessed with guns. How are we ever going to stop gun violence if we don‚Äôt get guns off the streets? And how are we ever going to get guns off the streets, if conservatives block every commonsense gun law?\n\nYou may dislike them because they‚Äôre so intolerant. What‚Äôs the harm of calling somebody by their preferred pronouns? Why can‚Äôt conservatives just show some compassion instead of obsessing over every kind of behavior they don‚Äôt like?\n\nYou may dislike them because if they got their way, they‚Äôd get rid of democracy and establish an authoritarian theocracy. Bye-bye separation of church and state. Hello, fascism.\n\nAfter all that, you might sum up conservatives in one word: ugh.\n\nIf any of this resonates with you, I get it. I‚Äôve been there. But‚Äîand this surprised me‚ÄîI found they actually have reasons for thinking the way they do. \n\nHere are some of them.\n\nOn abortion: To start, we can agree that no one likes abortion. But there is a clear divide on the issue. Progressives focus their attention on the mother. Conservatives, while they have compassion for the mother, focus their attention on the baby. They see a human being growing in a mother‚Äôs womb as innocent and vulnerable. Those babies deserve to be protected, since they obviously can‚Äôt protect themselves. \n\nOn racism: Conservatives don‚Äôt deny that racist people exist, but when it comes to the narrative of systemic racism, conservatives are unconvinced. Of course there are disparities in this country, but why assume that these disparities are because of racism? Good schools, good parents, good habits, and good communities would go much further toward alleviating poverty and expanding opportunity than a lifetime of racial justice movements. By the way, these rules apply to everyone, regardless of skin color.\n\nOn climate change: Conservatives have very little faith in computer models that have been inaccurately predicting disaster for nearly half a century. Conservatives have a lot of faith, however, in human ingenuity to overcome climate. What is air conditioning but a human adaptation to the environment? See Miami or Phoenix for further reference. This is not to say we should simply do nothing. Nuclear power, for example, holds so much promise as a renewable and safe energy source. Conservatives don‚Äôt understand why environmentalists oppose it. It makes them skeptical‚Äîand suspicious‚Äîthat the real agenda behind the environmentalist movement is not saving the planet, but giving more power to the government to control people‚Äôs lives.\n\nFor the full script, visit: https://www.prageru.com/video/why-do-you-hate-conservatives","thumbnail":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/MKHSv6XiNQY/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"33786","thumbCount":"4246"},{"id":"JQUPEIXDLVg","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UCdC0An4ZPNr_YiFiYoVbwaw","channelName":"Daily Dose Of Internet","title":"He Let the Intrusive Thoughts Win","published":"2022-10-24T19:30:01+00:00","updated":"2022-10-25T00:40:45+00:00","authorName":"Daily Dose Of Internet","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdC0An4ZPNr_YiFiYoVbwaw","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQUPEIXDLVg","description":"Hello everyone, this is YOUR Daily Dose of Internet.

He is a founding board member and the director of ethnopharmacology at the Heffter Research Institute, a non-profit exploring the therapeutic uses of psychedelic medicines. McKenna received his masters in botany at the University of Hawaii in 1979, followed by his doctorate in the same field at the University of British Columbia in 1984. Dennis is the brother of Terrence McKenna, a cultural figure and proponent for the exploration of psychedelics. Together they co-authored The Invisible Landscape. Much later Dennis would write a memoir, Brotherhood of the Screaming Abyss,  detailing he and his brothers exploits in the field. Today, Dennis tours and lectures, while also running the  Mckenna Academy of Natural Philosophy, which seeks to uncover the mysteries of consciousness held within the realm of botany and pharmacology.\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n‚ÄîLinks‚Äî \n\nMcKenna Academy: https://mckenna.academy\n\nThe Experiment at La Chorrera https://mckenna.academy/events?id=32 \n\nESPD55 Livestream Symposium ESPD55.com\n\nThose interested in donations may contact connect@mckenna.academy\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nBirch Gold - Text \"JORDAN\" to 989898 for your no-cost, no-obligation, FREE information kit\n\nElysium Health - Save 25% off Basis monthly subscriptions with code JBP25: https://trybasis.com/Jordan\n\nShopify - Get a FREE 14-day trial with full access to Shopify's entire suite of features: https://shopify.com/jbp\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(0:40) intro\n(2:33) Dr. Dennis McKenna now\n(6:47) What is ethnopharmacology?\n(12:45) Ayahuasca\n(26:02) Hierarchy of concepts\n(30:00) The Reality Hallucination\n(43:50) Breaking down hyper reality \n(49:30) Commonalities of entities\n(55:50) The intrinsic form of personality\n(1:00:15) Ritual, bad shamans\n(1:02:58) Carl Rogers, voluntary exposure\n(1:09:15) Roland Griffiths, the flaw in how medicine is practiced\n(1:12:05) Impending mortality\n(1:24:45) Dr. McKenna‚Äôs future plans\n(1:26:19) Looking back at a life long career \n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus #podcast #DennisMcKenna #psychedelics #science #drugs","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/tJE8HYFrkT4/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"44971","thumbCount":"2904"},{"id":"DVZec56Z2yQ","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","channelName":"Jordan B Peterson","title":"Little Winnie","published":"2022-10-24T18:27:13+00:00","updated":"2022-10-24T19:12:20+00:00","authorName":"Jordan B Peterson","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVZec56Z2yQ","description":"Order here: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/abc-of-childhood-tragedy/\n\nWickedly penned by Dr. Jordan B Peterson, an ABC of Childhood Tragedy unforgettably depicts the doomed and desperate lives of Adella, Bertram, Cynthia and their cohort of catastrophe. Twenty-six dark and witty poems, each a tragic comedy of innocence and vulnerability. Twenty-six hauntingly beautiful portrayals of injustice and suffering, each from the gifted imagination of Juliette Fogra, illustrator of Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life. If A Nightmare before Christmas or Coraline struck you to the heart, if the gothic raillery of Edward Gorey‚Äôs Gashlycrumb Tinies seduced you to smile satirically, if the Brothers Grimm were nowhere near grim enough for you, then An ABC of Childhood Tragedy might just be the book you‚Äôve been pining for.
