But we can't do that. I'll explain why. Also, new documents reveal how the government has been using Big Tech to squash the First Amendment. The Supreme Court possibly prepares to ban systemic anti-white racism in college admissions. The government begins its UFO cover up. And a woman on TikTok explains why white people are morally obligated to refrain from watching the new Black Panther film. I'm already one step ahead of her on that. \n\n- - - \n\nDailyWire+:\n\nStay informed by listening to Morning Wire and Election Wire on DailyWire+, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you listen to podcasts\n\nBecome a DailyWire+ member to watch the brand new DailyWire+ series “Dr. Jordan B.

But the most important thing the media wants us to know about this story is that it’s all the fault of Republicans, and also that we’re not allowed to ask any questions about it. Also, Elon officially takes the helm at Twitter, and immediately start instituting a number of important changes. And Barack Obama takes to the campaign trail to save the Democrats from the coming Red Wave. An NBA star shuts down a reporter in satisfying fashion. And another Starbucks employee has an emotional meltdown on camera.

The combined episode includes the following chapters:\n00:00 Introduction\n02:57 The Law\n16:06 The Courts\n29:25 The Prisons\n39:55 The Police\n53:36 The Peace in the Provinces\n\nIn the first chapter we consider the very foundation of Law & Order by examining the Law itself. We cover this subject by tracing its chronological evolution from the Roman Monarchy to the Roman Republic and finally the Roman Empire. \n\nIn the second chapter we examine how laws were interpreted and applied by Rome's judicial system as over the years. This includes the emergence of many aspects of Roman justice like judges, lawyers, juries, and more which will seem very familiar to us today. \n\nIn the third chapter we look at the practice of prisons which did indeed exist but served a far smaller role than our own form of mass incarceration today.\n\nIn the fourth chapter we turn our attention to Law Enforcement in Ancient Rome which included such elements as the Vigiles, the Praetorian Guard, and more.\n\nAnd finally we conclude with the fifth chapter which addresses the wider law and order across the Empire.\n\nCredits:\nResearch: Chris Das Neves\nScript: Chris Das Neves\nArt: Beverly Johnson\nEditing: Invicta\n\nBibliography and Suggested Reading:\nLaw Making in the Later Roman Republic, Alan Watson, 1974.\nA Legal History of Rome, George Mousourakis, 2007.\nThe Historical and Institutional Context of Roman Law, George Mousourakis, 2003.\nRoman Law in Context, David Johnston, 1999.\nRoman Law: An Introduction, Rafael Domingo, 2018.\nHistorical Introduction to the Study of Roman Law, HF Jolowicz and Barry Nicholas, 1972.\nAn Introduction to the Principles of Roman Law, P.

A pioneering researcher in this field, Christian Laforsch is primarily interested in the long-term hazards they pose - something that could assume critical importance for us in the future.\n\nMicroplastics can be found everywhere: in snow up in the mountains, in our rivers - and in the air that we breathe. They comprise particles so minute that they can only be seen under a microscope. Professor Christian Laforsch and his team from the University of Bayreuth have devised their own customized instruments to track down microplastics in water, the air and farmland soil. They also want to find out how dangerous they are for humans and our environment.\n\nSeema Agarwal is a chemist who knows the problem all too well from her native India. She's working on the development of organic-based plastics that are 100% biodegradable. At the same time, she's trying to reach out to the chemical industry - because in her eyes, the obvious and ultimate goal is to prevent microplastics being created in the first place. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #microplastics \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

They retracted them, sure, but it was no accident. They targeted a few of my favorite websites. I consider myself libertarian-leaning and agree with you guys on a host of issues. But I always get confused when you defend PayPal as NOT being a monopoly.

What changed? Christian Watson, host of Pensive Politics, has the surprising answer.\n\nLearn more about Christian Watson and watch Pensive Politics here: https://www.youtube.com/c/ChristianWatson/videos\n\n#dei #diversity #equity #prageru \n\nSUBSCRIBE 👉 https://www.prageru.com/join\n\nScript:\n\nTwenty or fifty or even a hundred years ago, if you asked someone which of the world’s countries was the most diverse, most equitable, and most inclusive, they would have almost certainly answered “the United States.”\n\nNot anymore.\n\nWhat changed?\n\nWell, nothing… and everything.  \n\nNothing in the sense that America is still the opportunity-rich place it’s always been.\n\nAnd everything because the progressive left has hijacked those three words—diversity, equity, and inclusion—and turned them into weapons of mass destruction. This DEI trio makes up the neutron bomb that has laid waste to a good part of our educational and corporate institutions.\n\nGiven the damage that has been done, it might be a good idea to see what these words used to mean and what they mean now.\n\nDiversity used to mean that people of different backgrounds were free to join a group or association. \n\nEquity used to mean enforcing equal standards for all individuals and groups. \n\nInclusion used to mean allowing people of every background and identity to participate in a group or association.\n\nNow, in their DEI context, these words all mean one thing: applying unequal standards to ensure preferential outcomes for individuals and groups based on race, sex, and gender identity.\n\nThe DEI movement is not about a sincere desire to make educational or corporate institutions more diverse, more equitable, or more inclusive. \n\nIf you don’t believe me, try having an open discussion on your company message board or at your next DEI seminar about why the same standards should apply to everyone, everywhere, regardless of race, sex, or gender identity. \n\nTry that and you know what will happen: You’ll be shouted down, shunned, reprimanded, and maybe fired.\n\nDEI is ultimately about only one thing: advancing those who are not white, heterosexual, and male at the expense of white, heterosexual men, regardless of their respective qualifications.\n\nIf you say, well, that’s fine because white, heterosexual men had too many advantages for too long, then I would ask: What about all the women, gays, blacks, and Latinos who were born into privilege? Should they be recipients of special DEI preferences? \n\nAnd when do we know we’ve reached a DEI endpoint? When do we know that everything is finally diverse, equitable and inclusive?\n\nThere are no good answers to any of these questions. That’s a feature, not a bug of the DEI racket.  America will never be able to DEI its way out of its DEI “problem.” It’s the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. You never reach your goal because it doesn’t exist. You’ll never quite be diverse enough, equitable enough or inclusive enough.\n\nThe DEI obsession has been great for one group of people and one group only: The lavishly paid DEI administrators at every Fortune 100 company, college, and university; and all those who work under them.\n\nCorporations now pay millions upon millions of dollars to so-called DEI experts to spread division and distrust among their own employees. It may be the single most non-productive, self-destructive thing a business can do to itself. But businesses, to their everlasting shame, are doing it anyway.\n\nThey think they’re trapped. If they don’t set up a DEI office, that proves their company is racist, sexist and homophobic. But if they do set up a DEI office, that proves their company is racist, sexist and homophobic. Or why else did they set up a DEI office in the first place?\n\nHeads DEI wins, tails you lose.\n\nFor the full script, visit: https://www.prageru.com/video/the-dei-disaster","thumbnail":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/1lPl80AqMDU/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"154064","thumbCount":"2142"},{"id":"3LecUuAc4kc","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UC4pNDofN0Xh-z2bhh62g8Ow","channelName":"Not What You Think","title":"Little MONSTER Tank #shorts","published":"2022-11-01T18:25:23+00:00","updated":"2022-11-01T18:35:13+00:00","authorName":"Not What You Think","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4pNDofN0Xh-z2bhh62g8Ow","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LecUuAc4kc","description":"This is Goliath, a small remote demolition vehicle that German's used to blow up bridges and tanks.

A good comedian can see the ridiculous everywhere, irrespective of their personal politics, and getting audiences to laugh at themselves or at “their side” can burst the bubble of self-righteousness that can so easily blossom into anger and resentment. When we are laughing together, we can’t hate each other, and that’s why the role of the court jester remains such an important one.\n\nWatch Kibbe on Liberty on BlazeTV: https://blazetv.com/kibbe\nFollow Kibbe on Liberty on Facebook: https://facebook.com/KibbeBlazeTV\nFollow Free the People on YouTube: https://youtube.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Twitter: https://twitter.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Instagram: https://instagram.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Facebook: https://facebook.com/freethepeople\nVisit Free the People's Website: https://freethepeople.org\n\nKibbe on Liberty is a weekly podcast with libertarian author, economist, and community organizer Matt Kibbe. As the president of Free the People, Kibbe has decades of experience in the libertarian political sphere, but in these troubled times he believes that open dialogue is needed to bring people together. This means being willing to talk, and especially listen, to those with whom we might not always agree, trying to understand perspectives that might otherwise be foreign to us.\n\nKibbe on Liberty's growing roster of guests includes politicians, economists, comedians, writers, radio personalities, activists, journalists, and even a magician or two—with topics of conversation ranging from current affairs to craft beer and the Grateful Dead. So grab a cold one, and settle in for the next hour of Kibbe on Liberty, mostly honest conversations with mostly interesting people.","thumbnail":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/QYoRTK3SaAU/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"42","thumbCount":"3"},{"id":"eq6A4c5TYlI","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UCyKgD0DLtBN21gfThSalyUQ","channelName":"Melissa Dougherty","title":"Archaeological Evidence for Jesus and the Gospels:Shroud of Turin, Jesus' \"Wife\", Miracles and More.","published":"2022-10-31T13:31:49+00:00","updated":"2022-10-31T13:31:51+00:00","authorName":"Melissa Dougherty","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyKgD0DLtBN21gfThSalyUQ","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq6A4c5TYlI","description":"What does historical and archaeological evidence say about Jesus?
