When they ran a query on the plate, they discovered that the 33-year-old Daniel Harris had a felony warrant for terroristic threats. Before the deputy could remove Harris from the vehicle, he escaped. The Brevard County deputies started the pursuit around 2:05 pm. The Florida Highway Patrol received the call around 2:09 p.m. that Brevard deputies were pursuing Harris and  joined the pursuit a few minutes later as the white Kia Soul deputies were tailing drove between 55 and 75 mph down the Beachline around mile marker 26. Harris made no attempt to stop and continued switching lanes, despite troopers activating their emergency lights and sirens. \n\nMultiple FHP vehicles actively attempt to slow down the Kia by braking in front of it and repeatedly ramming into the vehicle. Sgt. Spencer Ross tried to slow Harris down by breaking in front of him before he needed to use a PIT, or precision immobilization technique, but footage shows the Kia regained control. Sgt. Ross initiated a second PIT maneuver and successfully disabled Harris‚Äô vehicle. Harris is then seen getting out of the vehicle with his hands up. Aerial footage shows a swarm of FHP cruisers surround Harris as the pursuit culminates in an arrest in Orange County. Harris was transported to the Orange County Jail, where he faces multiple charges, including for terroristic threats, fleeing and eluding a law enforcement officer and driving with a suspended license.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nSpecial thanks to Shout-Out Supporters on Patreon:\n- Gianni M.\n- Charles Cooper\n- Joe\n- Cooper Malley\n- Luis Perez\n- Chris Wesley\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/4HSu3TBEUP8/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"5427","thumbCount":"660"},"failDate":1666306500685},{"videoId":"AnxEoSzVVQ4","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDxQssYjQexIV35bM_GbbPCQ","errors":[{"message":"Internal error encountered.","domain":"global","reason":"backendError"}],"video":{"id":"AnxEoSzVVQ4","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UCwUizOU8pPWXdXNniXypQEQ","channelName":"AwakenWithJP","title":"Please Censor This! | Comedy Special Trailer","published":"2022-10-20T15:52:00+00:00","updated":"2022-10-20T20:18:22+00:00","authorName":"AwakenWithJP","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwUizOU8pPWXdXNniXypQEQ","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnxEoSzVVQ4","description":"Learn more here: http://pleasecensorthis.locals.com/ \nThis full length special is fully uncensored and is created for freedom lovers.

The turbo is oil feed and the turbo seals were leaking into the exhaust side (hot side) of the turbo which caused the oil to pour out of the exhaust (hood stack) and onto everywhere on the truck.\n0:20 Some crazy \"curb rash\" on a customer's vehicle that just came in for a service. Look's like somebody did this on purpose it's so bad.\n0:30 The technician said: \"Aftermarket steel wheels rotted/rusted bad enough to crack and separate from the center hub.\"\n0:41 From the looks of it, the bolt that tightens the strut to the steering knuckle/spindle must have been loose to cause this. As the strut slides into the knuckle and it's just one bolt that holds it together.\n0:59 Look's like the customers drove into a parking barrier in a parking lot. From what we can see the oil pan is dented in, the transmission housing is cracked, the transmission pan is cracked, and the transmission mount is broken. They didn't mention how much the repairs cost.\n1:15 Missing brake pads, and brake caliper not bolted on the passenger rear side and re-used the old brake pads on the driver's side. Unsure why somebody would use all-new parts but not brake pads. \n1:31 The technician said: \"Customer complained about a wet dog smell from the AC a few weeks after maintenance and demands a free ac cleaning treatment, when getting the car inside we noticed a soaking wet raincoat and a dog bench / Carrier on the back seat. When we told him we found this he got angry 'do you think I'm stupid? My dog doesn't smell'.\"\n1:43 It's the drain for the convertible top. So all the water that collects on the top would make its way to the drain and leak out of the bottom of the car. But in this case, it got so full of water because the drain was plugged and it made its way to the window motor which most likely caused it to short out.\n2:00 Inner and outer tie-rod end on a VW Beetle. The inner tie rod (left side) is supposed to thread into the outer tie-rod end. As you can see it just slide's in. The technician thinks the jam nut was maybe loose so the inner tie-rod end was vibrating and slowly wore out the threads in the inner tie-rod. If you have any idea what you think happened. Let us know!\n2:10 Looks like the welds that hold the axle to the trailer broke. The customer is lucky nothing bad happened on his 200-mile trip. \n2:20 No brakes, rotors are halfway worn, and a loose wheel bearing.\nNo extra info. \n2:29 As mentioned the bolts for the lower control arm were almost all the way backed out. Seems like it's been that way for a while as the holes are slightly worn.\n2:43 Hyundai (didn't mention model) had a hole in the engine block and was still running. \n2:50 Most shops won't repair a tire if they have more than 3 leaks/holes. So this customer would need to get 4 new tires. Most likely picked up these roofing nails at a construction site.\n3:08 They didn't mention how this happened but my guess is that the tire was overfilled or damaged and shouldn't be taken out of service. The one person is lucky they moved!\n3:19 Outro.

While on routine patrol, he observed a black Chevy Tahoe traveling southbound on United States Highway 65 with tags that expired in March of 2022. Trp. Morphis activated emergency equipment to conduct a traffic stop on the vehicle for the observed violation. Once emergency equipment was activated, the vehicle continued to travel southbound on United States Highway 65. Approximately one mile after activating the emergency equipment, the driver of the vehicle turned his right turn signal on, but continued to travel southbound at a speed of 61 mph. \n\nAfter approximately 1.5 miles, Trp. Morphis advised ASP-Troop F Dispatch that they were still continuing southbound. Trooper Tyler Grant was approximately two miles south of Trp. Morphis location on United States Highway 65 and responded to assist him. Pursuant to Arkansas State Police Policy (LE SEC 18), Trp. Grant took primary position of the pursuit in his marked ASP unit. They continued southbound on United States Highway 65 for approximately one more mile. Once in a safe location, Trp. Grant moved into position to perform a Precision Immobilization Technique (PIT). A PIT maneuver was successfully conducted, resulting in the vehicle exiting the roadway and traveling into the west roadside ditch. Once in the roadside ditch, the vehicle overturned two times, and came to final rest on its roof. \n\nThe driver, identified as John Jones and the passenger, identified as Justin Hurd, were both removed from the vehicle and taken into custody without further incident. Pafford EMS responded to the scene and examined both suspects. Both suspects refused medical treatment and were transported to the Lake Village Jail. Jones was charged with Felony Fleeing, Reckless Driving, No Liability Insurance, No Seatbelt, Driving on Suspended Driver's License, and Expired Registration. Jones also had a nationwide extradition warrant out of the Arkansas Board of Parole, and an additional warrant out of the Chicot County Sheriff's Office for commercial burglary.

McKinney was wanted for a homicide that occurred in Albuquerque, on August 20, 2022. McKinney also had a probation violation warrant in Colorado. Albuquerque Police believe that McKinney was in Mesa, based off of cell phone records which showed him in the area of Dobson and Baseline roads. His vehicle was described as a black 2011 Jeep Patriot, equipped with multiple spotlights and red and blue lights inside to mimic a police car. Just after 3:30 PM detectives spotted McKinney's vehicle parked outside of a pizzeria on Dobson and Baseline Road. Detectives confirmed that McKinney was sitting inside a cell phone store next to the pizzeria. \n\nMcKinney left the wireless store and got into the driver's seat of his vehicle, that's what Mesa police officers positioned one of their vehicles at the back of McKinney's to contain him. Officers shouted for McKinney to exit the vehicle with his hands up. McKinney tried to back up into the police vehicle and that's when officers fired Les lethal beanbag rounds at his vehicle. McKinney quickly put his car in drive and drove forward, accelerating into the pizza restaurant. That is when multiple officers shot their Duty weapons. A surveillance video from inside the restaurant shows the vehicle breaking through the front door as three employees and one customer were inside. At the time, none of them were injured. McKinney stopped moving his vehicle and after a short time exited his vehicle. He was taken to the hospital and treated for gunshot wounds. Kevin McKinney faces multiple charges. A revolver and knives were recovered from McKinney's vehicle.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nSpecial thanks to Shout-Out Supporters on Patreon:\n- Jacob\n- 'gorey hole'\n- Gianni M.\n- Charles Cooper\n- Joe\n- Cooper Malley\n- Luis Perez\n- Chris Wesley\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity","thumbnail":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/qB3n9anQ7GM/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"102957","thumbCount":"6098"},"failDate":1666380431962},{"videoId":"vgCVHdFnj54","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDyK2zVsJSyquSdp7IVNEDTH","errors":[{"message":"Internal error encountered.","domain":"global","reason":"backendError"}],"video":{"id":"vgCVHdFnj54","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UCXMYxKMh3prxnM_4kYZuB3g","channelName":"PoliceActivity","title":"Bodycam Video of Deputies Responding to and Shooting Man in Stolen Car","published":"2022-10-21T18:23:10+00:00","updated":"2022-10-21T18:23:10+00:00","authorName":"PoliceActivity","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXMYxKMh3prxnM_4kYZuB3g","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgCVHdFnj54","description":"* (Disclaimer: This video content is intended for educational and informational purposes only) *\nDenver, Colorado ‚Äî On March 3, 2022, while on patrol, Deputy Daniel Willmont with the Arapahoe County Sheriff‚Äôs Office received a citizen request to investigate a suspicious vehicle. Deputy Willmont learned the suspicious vehicle had been reported stolen and called for assistance. Once on scene, the deputies contacted the suspect, who was sitting in the driver‚Äôs seat of the stolen vehicle, a brown Kia Sportage SUV. The deputies announced themselves and attempted to obtain the suspect‚Äôs voluntary surrender, but the suspect failed to comply with the deputies‚Äô commands to show both of his hands. \n\nThe suspect then placed the stolen vehicle into reverse and hit the patrol vehicle where Deputy Willmont was positioned. As the stolen vehicle reversed, Deputy Foley deployed his taser through the driver‚Äôs side window and Deputy Willmont fired his agency-issued rifle through the rear window of the stolen vehicle. The suspect then placed the vehicle into drive. Once the vehicle came to a stop, the deputies removed the suspect, secured him and rendered emergency aid after determining he had suffered a single gunshot wound to the back. Deputies requested fire rescue and advanced life support resources but the suspect, 30-year-old Jamarian McGhee, was pronounced dead at the scene.

It was one of the world's first known settlements, founded some 9,000 years ago. The site has produced magnificent finds including an ancient necklace made of 2,500 beads.\n\nWhat prompted our Neolithic ancestors to settle down? Why did they change their nomadic, hunter-gatherer lives so radically? As is so often the case in archaeology, it is tombs that tell us the most, while also raising new questions. \n\nOne of the most magnificent finds at the Ba'ja archaeological site is the richly furnished tomb of a young girl. In 2018, as the excavation team was about to depart, beads emerged from beneath the slab of a nondescript tomb. The team kept working until they finally recovered around 2,500 beads. Further research showed the beads belonged to an elaborately crafted necklace that had been buried with the girl. The team affectionately christened her Jamila, \"the beautiful one.\"\nJamila's necklace is a sensation, and has been put on display at the new Petra Museum. There, the entire history of the country is presented, beginning with Ba'ja and humankind‚Äôs decision to leave behind the hunter-gatherer lifestyle.\n\nAlong with other finds from Ba'ja, Jamila's finely wrought necklace calls into question much of what we thought we knew about the Stone Age. In recent decades, the burial site in Jordan has helped us see Neolithic people through different eyes. One thing seems clear: They were able to invest time in aesthetics, jewelry and furnishings because their food supply was secure.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #jordan #archeology \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

He stood beside Florida governor Ron DeSantis as he announced the \"Stop WOKE Act,\" on which Rufo has consulted. He's advised state lawmakers around the country on k-12 and higher education bills. And after the Walt Disney Company publicly opposed one of DeSantis' education bills, Rufo published leaked videos of internal meetings in which one executive producer discussed her \"not-at-all secret gay agenda\" and a production coordinator referenced a tracking tool meant to boost the representation of trans and \"gender non-conforming\" characters. Boycotts of Disney ensued, and DeSantis eventually revoked the company's special governance district.&#13;\n&#13;\nReason's Nick Gillespie and Zach Weissmueller discuss with Rufo¬† his war on \"woke,\" what further policy changes he seeks, and what libertarians should think about his objectives and tactics in the livestream embedded above.","thumbnail":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/94GDPOFH6_w/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"2926","thumbCount":"208"},{"id":"9t2thxcLgq8","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UCAPLyCPMWlJ0hZCS5-A8loA","channelName":"Maiorianus","title":"What clothes did the late Romans wear after the 3rd century AD?","published":"2022-10-20T11:18:49+00:00","updated":"2022-10-20T11:18:49+00:00","authorName":"Maiorianus","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAPLyCPMWlJ0hZCS5-A8loA","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9t2thxcLgq8","description":"üî¥ YOU WANT TO SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL? üî¥\nü§ó Join our Patreon community: https://www.patreon.com/Maiorianus\nOr become an official Maiorianus member on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/Maiorianus461/join\n\n\nü§ó One-Time Donation?\n       - PayPal: https://paypal.me/Maiorianus\n       - Bitcoin: bc1qv4lsfsplvfecrrgvmfclhga28we7mvh9563xdj\nüîó Share the video with anyone who might be interested (it helps a ton!)\nüëç Subscribe to our videos FOR FREE: https://www.youtube.com/c/Maiorianus461?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\nThe wonderful background music is by Adrian von Ziegler: https://youtu.be/USz9cwVSaqg\n\nüì¨ Contact us: maiorianus.sebastian@gmail.com\n#Maiorianus","thumbnail":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/9t2thxcLgq8/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"8836","thumbCount":"982"},{"id":"O-OmrYBi4W0","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UC4pNDofN0Xh-z2bhh62g8Ow","channelName":"Not What You Think","title":"Shooting Around The Corner WITHOUT Looking #shorts","published":"2022-10-20T16:20:35+00:00","updated":"2022-10-20T21:57:59+00:00","authorName":"Not What You Think","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4pNDofN0Xh-z2bhh62g8Ow","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-OmrYBi4W0","description":"These augmented reality goggles, are #NotWhatYouThink #NWYT #shorts\n\nMusic:\nThe Beginning of an Era - Bonnie Grace\n\nFootage:\nUS Department of Defense\n\nNote: \"The appearance of U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) visual information does not imply or constitute DoD endorsement.\"","thumbnail":"https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/O-OmrYBi4W0/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"26831","thumbCount":"3867"},{"id":"fa81bM3ngPg","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UCJ0kmBes7vSjT3QoWDfjwwg","channelName":"The New American Video","title":"Defending Property Rights against Carbon Pipeline","published":"2022-10-20T17:54:47+00:00","updated":"2022-10-20T21:38:42+00:00","authorName":"The New American Video","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ0kmBes7vSjT3QoWDfjwwg","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa81bM3ngPg","description":"Mark Lapka is a farmer in South Dakota, one of many who is in the crosshairs of government-subsidized private companies that are proposing to lay carbon capture pipelines across the midwest. Summit Carbon Solutions plans to install its Midwest Carbon Express across Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota, South Dakota and North Dakota, but in doing so, it will destroy valuable farmland in each of those states. It has threatened to use eminent domain to force farmers opposed to the scheme into involuntary compliance. Lapka gives us the inside scoop about what is going on in South Dakota, how landowners are fighting back, and why this issue impacts all Americans, especially as it is part of the United Nations‚Äô Agenda 2030 to rob us of private property rights altogether. \n\nüá∫üá∏ The New American:\nhttp://www.thenewamerican.com/\n\nüì≤ Let's Connect! \nhttp://www.facebook.com/TheNewAmerican\nhttps://twitter.com/NewAmericanMag\nhttps://www.instagram.com/newamericanmagazine\nhttps://rumble.com/c/TheNewAmerican","thumbnail":"https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/fa81bM3ngPg/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"76","thumbCount":"26"},{"id":"feS1zuKz2N8","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","channelName":"Jordan B Peterson","title":"Changing How We Perceive the World | Dr. Karl Friston | #298","published":"2022-10-20T18:10:03+00:00","updated":"2022-10-20T18:19:12+00:00","authorName":"Jordan B Peterson","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feS1zuKz2N8","description":"Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh\n\nDr. Jordan B.

He is credited for inventing statistical parametric mapping, an international standard for the analysis of imaging data. His work also pertains to the free energy principle, and predictive coding theory.

In socialism countries like Venezuela, where the the currency is devalued and the economy collapses, people not only stop keeping pets, they start eating them. Despite what environmentalists may claim, animal welfare very much depends on human welfare, which means that economic systems like socialism are just as bad for cats and dogs as they are for people.\n\nWatch Kibbe on Liberty on BlazeTV: https://blazetv.com/kibbe\nFollow Kibbe on Liberty on Facebook: https://facebook.com/KibbeBlazeTV\nFollow Free the People on YouTube: https://youtube.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Twitter: https://twitter.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Instagram: https://instagram.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Facebook: https://facebook.com/freethepeople\nVisit Free the People's Website: https://freethepeople.org\n\nKibbe on Liberty is a weekly podcast with libertarian author, economist, and community organizer Matt Kibbe. As the president of Free the People, Kibbe has decades of experience in the libertarian political sphere, but in these troubled times he believes that open dialogue is needed to bring people together. This means being willing to talk, and especially listen, to those with whom we might not always agree, trying to understand perspectives that might otherwise be foreign to us.\n\nKibbe on Liberty's growing roster of guests includes politicians, economists, comedians, writers, radio personalities, activists, journalists, and even a magician or two‚Äîwith topics of conversation ranging from current affairs to craft beer and the Grateful Dead. So grab a cold one, and settle in for the next hour of Kibbe on Liberty, mostly honest conversations with mostly interesting people.","thumbnail":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/9ST7dYhZY1k/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"141","thumbCount":"21"},{"id":"LiXsMKSXxWk","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UCdeMVChrumySxV9N1w0Au-w","channelName":"The Duran","title":"Liz Truss resigns, regime change success","published":"2022-10-20T17:18:13+00:00","updated":"2022-10-20T17:32:16+00:00","authorName":"The Duran","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdeMVChrumySxV9N1w0Au-w","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiXsMKSXxWk","description":"Liz Truss resigns, regime change success\nThe Duran: Episode 1413\n\n*****LOCALS COMMUNITY***** \nhttps://theduran.locals.com\n\n1 MONTH FREE TRIAL:\nhttps://theduran.locals.com/support/promo/DURANLOCALS\n\n*****THE DURAN SHOP*****\nhttp://drnshop.com\n10% OFF COUPON.

This documentary presents the history of taxation, from the French Revolution to political protest movements like France‚Äôs \"Gilets Jaunes‚Äù.\n\nTaxation has always been a topic of fierce political debate. After the 2008 financial crisis and the austerity policies that followed, voices of protest were heard all over Europe: whether from Brexit supporters in the United Kingdom, the \"Gilets Jaunes‚Äù (or \"yellow vests‚Äù) in France, or those disadvantaged by German reunification. These protests highlight a growing mistrust of citizens toward their governments. Tax policy, it turns out, is often a bone of contention.\n\nSince the American Revolution, with its rallying cry of \"No taxation without representation\", taxation and popular sovereignty have been mutually dependent. Current protests are a reminder to those in power of this basic rule of democracy. Meanwhile, the protests themselves hark back to turbulent moments in history: Since the Middle Ages, taxation has led to repeated conflicts between Europeans and their rulers. This two-part documentary follows the trail of these conflicts.\n\nPart 2 will be published next week.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #taxes #taxation \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Instead of celebrating the abolition of chattel slavery, we now talk about wage slavery. A similar shift in mindset has happened across every dimension of human progress, leaving people feeling resentful rather than grateful.\n\nWatch Kibbe on Liberty on BlazeTV: https://blazetv.com/kibbe\nFollow Kibbe on Liberty on Facebook: https://facebook.com/KibbeBlazeTV\nFollow Free the People on YouTube: https://youtube.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Twitter: https://twitter.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Instagram: https://instagram.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Facebook: https://facebook.com/freethepeople\nVisit Free the People's Website: https://freethepeople.org\n\nKibbe on Liberty is a weekly podcast with libertarian author, economist, and community organizer Matt Kibbe. As the president of Free the People, Kibbe has decades of experience in the libertarian political sphere, but in these troubled times he believes that open dialogue is needed to bring people together. This means being willing to talk, and especially listen, to those with whom we might not always agree, trying to understand perspectives that might otherwise be foreign to us.\n\nKibbe on Liberty's growing roster of guests includes politicians, economists, comedians, writers, radio personalities, activists, journalists, and even a magician or two‚Äîwith topics of conversation ranging from current affairs to craft beer and the Grateful Dead. So grab a cold one, and settle in for the next hour of Kibbe on Liberty, mostly honest conversations with mostly interesting people.","thumbnail":"https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/vkJGDJD47Lc/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"25","thumbCount":"5"},{"id":"BL6_H2KBgd0","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UCdeMVChrumySxV9N1w0Au-w","channelName":"The Duran","title":"Russia prepares for next phase.
