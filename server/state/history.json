But his self-destruction is not solely his own fault. The blame also lies with the Democrat Party, and also his wife. I’ll explain. Also, the governor of New York humiliates herself in her debate. Not quite as bad as Fetterman, but almost. And chest mutilation procedures on minors have risen by 400 percent in the last few years. Plus, we’ll hear from a Hungarian politician who explains why they don’t have to worry about this problem in their country. And Bono discovers, to his horror, that maybe free market capitalism isn’t so bad after all.\n\n- - - \n\nDailyWire+:\n\nBecome a DailyWire+ member to access movies, shows, documentaries and more: https://bit.ly/3dQINt0\n \nTune into Daily Wire Backstage TONIGHT at 7pm Eastern at dailywireplus.com\n\n - - - \n\nToday’s Sponsors:\n\nEpic Will - Use Promo Code 'WALSH' for 10% off your Will: https://www.epicwill.com/\n\n- - -\n\nStop giving your money to woke corporations that hate you.

A decade later, once high hopes for a \"Libyan Spring\" have long since vanished, as Libya is torn apart by civil war.\n\nForeign actors like Turkey and Russia are also moving in. \"They’re slicing up Libya like a cake,\" says Libyan activist Emad Shanab. Ankara and Moscow have seized their opportunity to gain a foothold in the Mediterranean country, upsetting the region’s geopolitical balance. In the chaos that followed the fall of Gaddafi, the terrorist militia IS was also able to set up operations in Libya.\n\nA popular uprising degenerated into ongoing civil war. The eastern and western parts of the country are divided into different camps under two rival governments. The younger generation is traumatized by ongoing conflict. As activist Emad Shanab asks: \"How long can this go on? What do we have to do? Leave the country? Die? Is dying our only choice?\"\n\nEurope is deeply divided over Libya. The divergent strategies of Western powers, with their conflicting economic interests, are only driving Libya further into disintegration. An influx of sophisticated weapons - despite a UN embargo - poses a growing threat to the security of the entire Mediterranean region.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #libya #civilwar \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

As a libertarian, Dixon saw the dangers of lockdowns earlier than most — dangers not only to his ability to earn a living but to the mental health of a nation deprived of human interaction. From there, the discussion swings through a variety of topics, including the business of magic, the healing power of comedy, drug legalization, and the Ron Paul revolution.\n\nWatch Kibbe on Liberty on BlazeTV: https://blazetv.com/kibbe\nFollow Kibbe on Liberty on Facebook: https://facebook.com/KibbeBlazeTV\nFollow Free the People on YouTube: https://youtube.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Twitter: https://twitter.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Instagram: https://instagram.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Facebook: https://facebook.com/freethepeople\nVisit Free the People's Website: https://freethepeople.org\n\nKibbe on Liberty is a weekly podcast with libertarian author, economist, and community organizer Matt Kibbe. As the president of Free the People, Kibbe has decades of experience in the libertarian political sphere, but in these troubled times he believes that open dialogue is needed to bring people together. This means being willing to talk, and especially listen, to those with whom we might not always agree, trying to understand perspectives that might otherwise be foreign to us.\n\nKibbe on Liberty's growing roster of guests includes politicians, economists, comedians, writers, radio personalities, activists, journalists, and even a magician or two—with topics of conversation ranging from current affairs to craft beer and the Grateful Dead. So grab a cold one, and settle in for the next hour of Kibbe on Liberty, mostly honest conversations with mostly interesting people.","thumbnail":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/msfvLi8KYys/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"4","thumbCount":"3"},{"id":"6Xz8sWfH7yA","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UCf_HItERkRB3vnkWt2RSOLg","channelName":"George Galloway","title":"MOATS Ep 182 with George Galloway","published":"2022-10-26T18:45:29+00:00","updated":"2022-10-26T18:48:16+00:00","authorName":"George Galloway","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf_HItERkRB3vnkWt2RSOLg","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xz8sWfH7yA","description":"GEORGE GALLOWAY ⎹  and The Mother of All Talk Shows","thumbnail":"https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/6Xz8sWfH7yA/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"0","thumbCount":"15"},null,{"id":"F6LTn8NwB0A","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UCa3C7WpFobavsDJdkKUtodw","channelName":"Behold Israel with Amir Tsarfati","title":"Amir Tsarfati: Climate Change: A New World Religion?","published":"2022-10-26T19:57:06+00:00","updated":"2022-10-26T21:09:53+00:00","authorName":"Behold Israel with Amir Tsarfati","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa3C7WpFobavsDJdkKUtodw","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6LTn8NwB0A","description":"Climate change - What is it?

Now, a private company called Navigator CO2 wants to install a pipeline across Iowa, and they’re planning to take property from farmers like the Junkers to do so. \n\nThe issue impacts not just these farmers, but every American who owns private property and who relies on the nation’s agricultural products in their daily lives. The Junkers encourage everyone to post comments with the Iowa Utilities Board at https://iub.iowa.gov/online-services/open-docket-comment-form and to educate themselves about the agenda behind projects like this pipeline – a United Nations scheme called Agenda 2030. \n\nRelated Video: Agenda 2030 Scheme Threatens Iowans with Eminent Domain
