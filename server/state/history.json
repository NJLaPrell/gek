When they ran a query on the plate, they discovered that the 33-year-old Daniel Harris had a felony warrant for terroristic threats. Before the deputy could remove Harris from the vehicle, he escaped. The Brevard County deputies started the pursuit around 2:05 pm. The Florida Highway Patrol received the call around 2:09 p.m. that Brevard deputies were pursuing Harris and  joined the pursuit a few minutes later as the white Kia Soul deputies were tailing drove between 55 and 75 mph down the Beachline around mile marker 26. Harris made no attempt to stop and continued switching lanes, despite troopers activating their emergency lights and sirens. \n\nMultiple FHP vehicles actively attempt to slow down the Kia by braking in front of it and repeatedly ramming into the vehicle. Sgt. Spencer Ross tried to slow Harris down by breaking in front of him before he needed to use a PIT, or precision immobilization technique, but footage shows the Kia regained control. Sgt. Ross initiated a second PIT maneuver and successfully disabled Harris‚Äô vehicle. Harris is then seen getting out of the vehicle with his hands up. Aerial footage shows a swarm of FHP cruisers surround Harris as the pursuit culminates in an arrest in Orange County. Harris was transported to the Orange County Jail, where he faces multiple charges, including for terroristic threats, fleeing and eluding a law enforcement officer and driving with a suspended license.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nSpecial thanks to Shout-Out Supporters on Patreon:\n- Gianni M.\n- Charles Cooper\n- Joe\n- Cooper Malley\n- Luis Perez\n- Chris Wesley\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/4HSu3TBEUP8/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"5427","thumbCount":"660"},"failDate":1666306500685},{"videoId":"AnxEoSzVVQ4","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDxQssYjQexIV35bM_GbbPCQ","errors":[{"message":"Internal error encountered.","domain":"global","reason":"backendError"}],"video":{"id":"AnxEoSzVVQ4","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UCwUizOU8pPWXdXNniXypQEQ","channelName":"AwakenWithJP","title":"Please Censor This! | Comedy Special Trailer","published":"2022-10-20T15:52:00+00:00","updated":"2022-10-20T20:18:22+00:00","authorName":"AwakenWithJP","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwUizOU8pPWXdXNniXypQEQ","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnxEoSzVVQ4","description":"Learn more here: http://pleasecensorthis.locals.com/ \nThis full length special is fully uncensored and is created for freedom lovers.

The turbo is oil feed and the turbo seals were leaking into the exhaust side (hot side) of the turbo which caused the oil to pour out of the exhaust (hood stack) and onto everywhere on the truck.\n0:20 Some crazy \"curb rash\" on a customer's vehicle that just came in for a service. Look's like somebody did this on purpose it's so bad.\n0:30 The technician said: \"Aftermarket steel wheels rotted/rusted bad enough to crack and separate from the center hub.\"\n0:41 From the looks of it, the bolt that tightens the strut to the steering knuckle/spindle must have been loose to cause this. As the strut slides into the knuckle and it's just one bolt that holds it together.\n0:59 Look's like the customers drove into a parking barrier in a parking lot. From what we can see the oil pan is dented in, the transmission housing is cracked, the transmission pan is cracked, and the transmission mount is broken. They didn't mention how much the repairs cost.\n1:15 Missing brake pads, and brake caliper not bolted on the passenger rear side and re-used the old brake pads on the driver's side. Unsure why somebody would use all-new parts but not brake pads. \n1:31 The technician said: \"Customer complained about a wet dog smell from the AC a few weeks after maintenance and demands a free ac cleaning treatment, when getting the car inside we noticed a soaking wet raincoat and a dog bench / Carrier on the back seat. When we told him we found this he got angry 'do you think I'm stupid? My dog doesn't smell'.\"\n1:43 It's the drain for the convertible top. So all the water that collects on the top would make its way to the drain and leak out of the bottom of the car. But in this case, it got so full of water because the drain was plugged and it made its way to the window motor which most likely caused it to short out.\n2:00 Inner and outer tie-rod end on a VW Beetle. The inner tie rod (left side) is supposed to thread into the outer tie-rod end. As you can see it just slide's in. The technician thinks the jam nut was maybe loose so the inner tie-rod end was vibrating and slowly wore out the threads in the inner tie-rod. If you have any idea what you think happened. Let us know!\n2:10 Looks like the welds that hold the axle to the trailer broke. The customer is lucky nothing bad happened on his 200-mile trip. \n2:20 No brakes, rotors are halfway worn, and a loose wheel bearing.\nNo extra info. \n2:29 As mentioned the bolts for the lower control arm were almost all the way backed out. Seems like it's been that way for a while as the holes are slightly worn.\n2:43 Hyundai (didn't mention model) had a hole in the engine block and was still running. \n2:50 Most shops won't repair a tire if they have more than 3 leaks/holes. So this customer would need to get 4 new tires. Most likely picked up these roofing nails at a construction site.\n3:08 They didn't mention how this happened but my guess is that the tire was overfilled or damaged and shouldn't be taken out of service. The one person is lucky they moved!\n3:19 Outro.

While on routine patrol, he observed a black Chevy Tahoe traveling southbound on United States Highway 65 with tags that expired in March of 2022. Trp. Morphis activated emergency equipment to conduct a traffic stop on the vehicle for the observed violation. Once emergency equipment was activated, the vehicle continued to travel southbound on United States Highway 65. Approximately one mile after activating the emergency equipment, the driver of the vehicle turned his right turn signal on, but continued to travel southbound at a speed of 61 mph. \n\nAfter approximately 1.5 miles, Trp. Morphis advised ASP-Troop F Dispatch that they were still continuing southbound. Trooper Tyler Grant was approximately two miles south of Trp. Morphis location on United States Highway 65 and responded to assist him. Pursuant to Arkansas State Police Policy (LE SEC 18), Trp. Grant took primary position of the pursuit in his marked ASP unit. They continued southbound on United States Highway 65 for approximately one more mile. Once in a safe location, Trp. Grant moved into position to perform a Precision Immobilization Technique (PIT). A PIT maneuver was successfully conducted, resulting in the vehicle exiting the roadway and traveling into the west roadside ditch. Once in the roadside ditch, the vehicle overturned two times, and came to final rest on its roof. \n\nThe driver, identified as John Jones and the passenger, identified as Justin Hurd, were both removed from the vehicle and taken into custody without further incident. Pafford EMS responded to the scene and examined both suspects. Both suspects refused medical treatment and were transported to the Lake Village Jail. Jones was charged with Felony Fleeing, Reckless Driving, No Liability Insurance, No Seatbelt, Driving on Suspended Driver's License, and Expired Registration. Jones also had a nationwide extradition warrant out of the Arkansas Board of Parole, and an additional warrant out of the Chicot County Sheriff's Office for commercial burglary.

McKinney was wanted for a homicide that occurred in Albuquerque, on August 20, 2022. McKinney also had a probation violation warrant in Colorado. Albuquerque Police believe that McKinney was in Mesa, based off of cell phone records which showed him in the area of Dobson and Baseline roads. His vehicle was described as a black 2011 Jeep Patriot, equipped with multiple spotlights and red and blue lights inside to mimic a police car. Just after 3:30 PM detectives spotted McKinney's vehicle parked outside of a pizzeria on Dobson and Baseline Road. Detectives confirmed that McKinney was sitting inside a cell phone store next to the pizzeria. \n\nMcKinney left the wireless store and got into the driver's seat of his vehicle, that's what Mesa police officers positioned one of their vehicles at the back of McKinney's to contain him. Officers shouted for McKinney to exit the vehicle with his hands up. McKinney tried to back up into the police vehicle and that's when officers fired Les lethal beanbag rounds at his vehicle. McKinney quickly put his car in drive and drove forward, accelerating into the pizza restaurant. That is when multiple officers shot their Duty weapons. A surveillance video from inside the restaurant shows the vehicle breaking through the front door as three employees and one customer were inside. At the time, none of them were injured. McKinney stopped moving his vehicle and after a short time exited his vehicle. He was taken to the hospital and treated for gunshot wounds. Kevin McKinney faces multiple charges. A revolver and knives were recovered from McKinney's vehicle.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nSpecial thanks to Shout-Out Supporters on Patreon:\n- Jacob\n- 'gorey hole'\n- Gianni M.\n- Charles Cooper\n- Joe\n- Cooper Malley\n- Luis Perez\n- Chris Wesley\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity","thumbnail":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/qB3n9anQ7GM/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"102957","thumbCount":"6098"},"failDate":1666380431962},{"videoId":"vgCVHdFnj54","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDyK2zVsJSyquSdp7IVNEDTH","errors":[{"message":"Internal error encountered.","domain":"global","reason":"backendError"}],"video":{"id":"vgCVHdFnj54","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UCXMYxKMh3prxnM_4kYZuB3g","channelName":"PoliceActivity","title":"Bodycam Video of Deputies Responding to and Shooting Man in Stolen Car","published":"2022-10-21T18:23:10+00:00","updated":"2022-10-21T18:23:10+00:00","authorName":"PoliceActivity","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXMYxKMh3prxnM_4kYZuB3g","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgCVHdFnj54","description":"* (Disclaimer: This video content is intended for educational and informational purposes only) *\nDenver, Colorado ‚Äî On March 3, 2022, while on patrol, Deputy Daniel Willmont with the Arapahoe County Sheriff‚Äôs Office received a citizen request to investigate a suspicious vehicle. Deputy Willmont learned the suspicious vehicle had been reported stolen and called for assistance. Once on scene, the deputies contacted the suspect, who was sitting in the driver‚Äôs seat of the stolen vehicle, a brown Kia Sportage SUV. The deputies announced themselves and attempted to obtain the suspect‚Äôs voluntary surrender, but the suspect failed to comply with the deputies‚Äô commands to show both of his hands. \n\nThe suspect then placed the stolen vehicle into reverse and hit the patrol vehicle where Deputy Willmont was positioned. As the stolen vehicle reversed, Deputy Foley deployed his taser through the driver‚Äôs side window and Deputy Willmont fired his agency-issued rifle through the rear window of the stolen vehicle. The suspect then placed the vehicle into drive. Once the vehicle came to a stop, the deputies removed the suspect, secured him and rendered emergency aid after determining he had suffered a single gunshot wound to the back. Deputies requested fire rescue and advanced life support resources but the suspect, 30-year-old Jamarian McGhee, was pronounced dead at the scene. A weapon was also recovered from the suspect.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nSpecial thanks to Shout-Out Supporters on Patreon:\n- Jacob\n- 'gorey hole'\n- Gianni M.\n- Charles Cooper\n- Joe\n- Cooper Malley\n- Luis Perez\n- Chris Wesley\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity","thumbnail":"https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/vgCVHdFnj54/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"26032","thumbCount":"2373"},"failDate":1666380432247},{"videoId":"Ls_EojGzhA4","playlistId":"PLLFJ6m60CtDxQssYjQexIV35bM_GbbPCQ","errors":[{"message":"Internal error encountered.","domain":"global","reason":"backendError"}],"video":{"id":"Ls_EojGzhA4","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UCbb5jNoRlRQ1UBjO_7fF_Iw","channelName":"JP Reacts","title":"Reacting to Scathing Fauci Documentary Trailer!","published":"2022-10-24T13:00:13+00:00","updated":"2022-10-24T18:30:42+00:00","authorName":"JP Reacts","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbb5jNoRlRQ1UBjO_7fF_Iw","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_EojGzhA4","description":"Be the first to see my Comedy Special at https://pleasecensorthis.locals.com\n\nWatch the Fauci Documentary Here - http://www.TheFauciTruth.com\n\nGet the Shirt I'm Wearing Here - https://bit.ly/3RocQqa\n\nSee my LIVE Comedy Shows - https://awakenwithjp.com/pages/tour\n\nTake a stand against censorship.

Democrat candidate for Governor: ‚ÄúSo, all across the country, Democrat candidates -- not candidates themselves -- but the [Democrat] Party was putting money in [Republican] primaries -- into the races of the extreme Trump endorsed candidates, as opposed to the moderate Republicans that were running.‚Äù \n‚Ä¢ Becky Hobbs: ‚ÄúThey [Democrat Party] wanted those [Trump-endorsed Republican] extremists to win because they knew that the Dems had a better chance of winning their races against the extremist candidates than they did against the moderate Republicans.‚Äù\n‚Ä¢ Becky Hobbs: ‚ÄúSo, on election night -- primary night -- when we were at Katie‚Äôs event on primary night, and she didn‚Äôt know the night of the election who her opponent was gonna be -- but [Republican] Karrin Taylor Robson was up by 10 points and it was kind of like, it took the air out of the room because everyone knew that Katie was polling better against Kari Lake, and everyone knew that Katie had a better chance to win against Kari Lake. So, everyone wanted Kari Lake to be the nominee.‚Äù\n‚Ä¢ Becky Hobbs: ‚ÄúSo, it was kind of like, this sigh of relief when Kari Lake actually ended up winning.‚Äù\n\n[PHOENIX ‚Äì Oct. 24, 2022] Project Veritas Action released a new video today featuring Becky Hobbs, who is the twin sister of Arizona‚Äôs Democrat candidate for governor, Katie Hobbs.\n\nIn the undercover video, Becky Hobbs is seen detailing how the Democrat Party financially supported Trump-backed candidates in Republican primaries.\n\n‚ÄúSo, all across the country, Democrat candidates -- not candidates themselves -- but the [Democrat] Party was putting money in [Republican] primaries -- into the races of the extreme Trump endorsed candidates, as opposed to the moderate Republicans that were running,‚Äù Becky Hobbs said.\n\n‚ÄúThey [Democrat Party] wanted those [Trump-endorsed Republican] extremists to win because they knew that the Dems had a better chance of winning their races against the extremist candidates than they did against the moderate Republicans,‚Äù she said.\nRecently, Democrat officials have voiced concern on their perception that the Republican Party is becoming more ‚Äúextreme‚Äù due to Trump-backed candidates winning their primaries.\n\nThis video of Becky Hobbs appears to confirm that Democrats contributed to that outcome, raising questions on whether Democrats fear so-called Trump extremism or if such alleged extremism is in fact politically convenient for them.\n\nAlso in the undercover video, Becky Hobbs talked about the Arizona gubernatorial Republican primary between Pence-backed Karrin Taylor Robson and Trump-backed Kari Lake.\n\n‚ÄúSo, on election night -- primary night -- when we were at Katie‚Äôs event on primary night, and she didn‚Äôt know the night of the election who her opponent was gonna be -- but [Republican] Karrin Taylor Robson was up by 10 points and it was kind of like, it took the air out of the room because everyone knew that Katie was polling better against Kari Lake, and everyone knew that Katie had a better chance to win against Kari Lake.

The investigation that took place in the subsequent days and months revealed this case (which, though the creatures described were silver, gave rise to the term \"little green men\") to be one of the strangest purported encounters with extraterrestrials ever recorded. In this video, we analyze this incident. \n\nThis video was originally uploaded to Lucinox in February of 2022.

It was one of the world's first known settlements, founded some 9,000 years ago. The site has produced magnificent finds including an ancient necklace made of 2,500 beads.\n\nWhat prompted our Neolithic ancestors to settle down? Why did they change their nomadic, hunter-gatherer lives so radically? As is so often the case in archaeology, it is tombs that tell us the most, while also raising new questions. \n\nOne of the most magnificent finds at the Ba'ja archaeological site is the richly furnished tomb of a young girl. In 2018, as the excavation team was about to depart, beads emerged from beneath the slab of a nondescript tomb. The team kept working until they finally recovered around 2,500 beads. Further research showed the beads belonged to an elaborately crafted necklace that had been buried with the girl. The team affectionately christened her Jamila, \"the beautiful one.\"\nJamila's necklace is a sensation, and has been put on display at the new Petra Museum. There, the entire history of the country is presented, beginning with Ba'ja and humankind‚Äôs decision to leave behind the hunter-gatherer lifestyle.\n\nAlong with other finds from Ba'ja, Jamila's finely wrought necklace calls into question much of what we thought we knew about the Stone Age. In recent decades, the burial site in Jordan has helped us see Neolithic people through different eyes. One thing seems clear: They were able to invest time in aesthetics, jewelry and furnishings because their food supply was secure.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #jordan #archeology \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

In socialism countries like Venezuela, where the the currency is devalued and the economy collapses, people not only stop keeping pets, they start eating them. Despite what environmentalists may claim, animal welfare very much depends on human welfare, which means that economic systems like socialism are just as bad for cats and dogs as they are for people.\n\nWatch Kibbe on Liberty on BlazeTV: https://blazetv.com/kibbe\nFollow Kibbe on Liberty on Facebook: https://facebook.com/KibbeBlazeTV\nFollow Free the People on YouTube: https://youtube.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Twitter: https://twitter.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Instagram: https://instagram.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Facebook: https://facebook.com/freethepeople\nVisit Free the People's Website: https://freethepeople.org\n\nKibbe on Liberty is a weekly podcast with libertarian author, economist, and community organizer Matt Kibbe. As the president of Free the People, Kibbe has decades of experience in the libertarian political sphere, but in these troubled times he believes that open dialogue is needed to bring people together. This means being willing to talk, and especially listen, to those with whom we might not always agree, trying to understand perspectives that might otherwise be foreign to us.\n\nKibbe on Liberty's growing roster of guests includes politicians, economists, comedians, writers, radio personalities, activists, journalists, and even a magician or two‚Äîwith topics of conversation ranging from current affairs to craft beer and the Grateful Dead. So grab a cold one, and settle in for the next hour of Kibbe on Liberty, mostly honest conversations with mostly interesting people.","thumbnail":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/9ST7dYhZY1k/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"141","thumbCount":"21"},{"id":"rzyOIwjYK7E","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UCTbcSRduRJJTMaQhUVqywRw","channelName":"Mentour Now!","title":"WHAT is Going On with BOOM Supersonic?!

This documentary presents the history of taxation, from the French Revolution to political protest movements like France‚Äôs \"Gilets Jaunes‚Äù.\n\nTaxation has always been a topic of fierce political debate. After the 2008 financial crisis and the austerity policies that followed, voices of protest were heard all over Europe: whether from Brexit supporters in the United Kingdom, the \"Gilets Jaunes‚Äù (or \"yellow vests‚Äù) in France, or those disadvantaged by German reunification. These protests highlight a growing mistrust of citizens toward their governments. Tax policy, it turns out, is often a bone of contention.\n\nSince the American Revolution, with its rallying cry of \"No taxation without representation\", taxation and popular sovereignty have been mutually dependent. Current protests are a reminder to those in power of this basic rule of democracy. Meanwhile, the protests themselves hark back to turbulent moments in history: Since the Middle Ages, taxation has led to repeated conflicts between Europeans and their rulers. This two-part documentary follows the trail of these conflicts.\n\nPart 2 will be published next week.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #taxes #taxation \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Cato Institute, discuss the fact that many people remain dissatisfied with modern life in spite of tremendous prosperity never seen before in history. Part of the reason for this is that we keep changing the definitions of problems so that it looks like we are making less progress than we actually are. Instead of celebrating the abolition of chattel slavery, we now talk about wage slavery. A similar shift in mindset has happened across every dimension of human progress, leaving people feeling resentful rather than grateful.\n\nWatch Kibbe on Liberty on BlazeTV: https://blazetv.com/kibbe\nFollow Kibbe on Liberty on Facebook: https://facebook.com/KibbeBlazeTV\nFollow Free the People on YouTube: https://youtube.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Twitter: https://twitter.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Instagram: https://instagram.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Facebook: https://facebook.com/freethepeople\nVisit Free the People's Website: https://freethepeople.org\n\nKibbe on Liberty is a weekly podcast with libertarian author, economist, and community organizer Matt Kibbe. As the president of Free the People, Kibbe has decades of experience in the libertarian political sphere, but in these troubled times he believes that open dialogue is needed to bring people together. This means being willing to talk, and especially listen, to those with whom we might not always agree, trying to understand perspectives that might otherwise be foreign to us.\n\nKibbe on Liberty's growing roster of guests includes politicians, economists, comedians, writers, radio personalities, activists, journalists, and even a magician or two‚Äîwith topics of conversation ranging from current affairs to craft beer and the Grateful Dead. So grab a cold one, and settle in for the next hour of Kibbe on Liberty, mostly honest conversations with mostly interesting people.","thumbnail":"https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/vkJGDJD47Lc/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"25","thumbCount":"5"},{"id":"BL6_H2KBgd0","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UCdeMVChrumySxV9N1w0Au-w","channelName":"The Duran","title":"Russia prepares for next phase.

That sounds like a heavy burden to me, to try to love and obey Jesus perfectly.&#13;\n2. 11:46 {Trusting God‚Äôs Will for our Loved Ones} We are supposed to trust God with all our hearts. But what does it look like to trust God with the free will decisions of others, like our adult children?&#13;\n3. 16:51 {Pastors Teaching Dream Interpretation?} What is your take on Christian pastors practicing and teaching dream interpretation using dream dictionaries, Google, and their own reasoning to interpret?&#13;\n4. 20:11 {Was Christianity Made Up to Control People?} What do you say to a skeptic that thinks Christianity is just a man-made thing created as a means to control people?&#13;\n5. 24:20 {Is Monarchy Unbiblical?} I‚Äôve been thinking about this question a lot since Queen Elizabeth died last month, but I‚Äôve had it for a while. Does 1 Samuel 8:6-7 teach that monarchy is unbiblical?&#13;\n6. 29:49 {Does Satan Think He‚Äôll Win in the End?} How can Satan, an angel much smarter than us, be so unwise as to oppose an all-powerful God? Does Satan think he stands a chance of winning in the end?&#13;\n7. 35:39 {Should Israel be Referred To as Palestine?} Why do you refer to biblical Israel as Palestine when Palestine wasn‚Äôt even a country until about 135 B.C.?&#13;\n8. 39:00 {Should I Date a Hyper-Charismatic?} I've been on a few dates with a great girl, but I've realized she's in a church that over emphasizes prophecy, tongues, possibly NAR things. Any advice on how to approach this?&#13;\n9. 42:33 {How Could Jesus have been ‚ÄúPerfected‚Äù?} Hebrews 5:9 says Jesus was \"perfected\" when He became the author of salvation to those who obey Him. How can an already perfect Jesus be ‚Äúperfected‚Äù?&#13;\n10. 46:00 {Does God fill the role of Heavenly Father AND Mother?} My 7 year old asked me why we need an earthly father AND mother, but only a Heavenly Father? I started to say God fills both roles, but was hesitant about that in this gender-confused culture.&#13;\n11. 50:11 {Overcoming Difficult & Serious Sins} Do believers eventually overcome big sins like lust? What if we don't before we die? Does that mean we were never saved?&#13;\n12. 54:40 {Knowing God‚Äôs Plan for our Career} How do you know what job/career God wants you to pursue?&#13;\n13. 57:50 {Are Only Men Called to Sacrificially Love?} Can you explain how Ephesians 5: 25 is a particularly masculine command? Many verses including John 15: 12-13 call ALL believers to love one another sacrificially.&#13;\n14. 1:00:59 {Did Luke Journey With Paul?} I have studied Acts verse-by-verse and I have noticed that in some parts the writer uses ‚Äúwe‚Äù and ‚Äúus‚Äù (Chapter 28 for example). Was Luke with Paul on his missionary journeys?&#13;\n15. 1:02:03 {Codex Vaticanus vs. Modern Bibles?} If the Codex Vaticanus is the oldest Bible, how much does it differ from modern Bibles, if at all?&#13;\n16. 1:06:00 {Overcoming a Fear of the Dark} How can I overcome a fear of the dark? Ever since I was young until now (I‚Äôm 25 years old), it‚Äôs hard for me to fall asleep every night because I‚Äôm scared that there might be something evil watching me sleeping.&#13;\n17. 1:09:40 {Does This Verse Justify False Teaching?} How should we understand 1 Corinthians 1: 18-2:5,14, 3: 18-19? Ray Comfort quoted this to say Bible stories are supposed to sound dumb! Can't this be quoted to justify any dumb-sounding false teaching?&#13;\n18. 1:14:50 {Why didn‚Äôt JTB‚Äôs Followers just Follow Jesus?} Why did John the Baptist still have disciples after he clearly pointed out Jesus? Shouldn't they have followed Jesus?&#13;\n19. 1:18:18 {Were the OT Sacrifices Cruel?} If God hates animal cruelty, why did He require animal sacrifices in the Old Testament?&#13;\n20. 1:20:54 {Eschatological Insights} What's your take on 2 Thessalonians 2:7? I've always used this as a proof text for the Church being removed before the time of the antichrist. That and 1 Thessalonians 5:9. Thoughts?\n\n\nI take questions from the live chat. Start your question with \"Q\" and try to include one or two specific verse references if you have them. Due to the number of questions we get I can't possibly answer them all so I apologize if you send one in that doesn't get an answer. \n\nhttps://BibleThinker.org","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/xKUxtq9cJRk/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"12898","thumbCount":"1052"},{"id":"BJzOZuPgcMc","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UCyl5V3-J_Bsy3x-EBCJwepg","channelName":"The Babylon Bee","title":"Californians Move to Texas | Episode 3: The Church","published":"2022-10-21T20:00:10+00:00","updated":"2022-10-21T20:28:26+00:00","authorName":"The Babylon Bee","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyl5V3-J_Bsy3x-EBCJwepg","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJzOZuPgcMc","description":"Everyone's favorite transplants from California, Steve and Timpani, are going door to door trying to get their new Texas neighbors to vote for Beto O'Rourke.

In this interview, Fort Myers residents Brianne Casey and Kynse Leigh Agles, both survivors of Ian and multiple other powerful hurricanes over the past decade, discuss their escape from their homes and their return to find those dwellings completely destroyed.\n\nAs Casey and Agles articulate, the process of recovery and rebuilding will be long-term, yet tremendous efforts are now underway to get Floridians the help they need. To support the relief effort, please go to the Florida Disaster Fund at www.volunteerflorida.org/florida-disaster-fund/ and the Fundraiser for Brianne Casey at

Theirs was a long history which dated back to the founding of Numenor. In these early days of the second age, the high men which forged a realm atop the Isle of Elena were led by a line of Kings. Such rulers had at their side not only a council to provide wisdom but also a guard to see to their safety. Part of this responsibility was extended to the White Tree of Numenor which stood as a symbol of the realm. \n\nFollowing the Fall of Numenor, the tradition of the Guard would be continued by the line of Numenoreans who escaped to establish the Kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor in Middle Earth. We trace their long history through the Second Age and into the Third Age which climaxed with the War of the Ring. We cover the equipment, organization, and service history of the Fountain Guard throughout this long period. In this way do we also cover the History of Gondor from the reign of the Kings, to the line of Stewards, and finally the Return of the King. We cover the various wars with Morder, the Easterlings, and Umbar with such conflicts as The Battle of Gladden Fields, The Battle of Pelennor Fields, and the Siege of Minas Tirith.\n\nWhat Units of Middle Earth would you like to see us cover next?\n\nIf you haven't already, check out our History of Middle Earth video which serves as a primer for lord of the rings lore from creation to the second age.\n\nCredits:\nResearch = Invicta\nScript = Invicta\nNarration = Edward Gil\nMaps = L'Arpenteur Cartography\nArtwork = Penta Limited\n\n#documentary \n#lordoftherings

rift between the political camps in the US remains deep. Now midterm elections are around the corner. The Republican Party is confident, while the Democrats fear they'll lose ground ‚Äì including in Wisconsin.\n\nTwo years ago, Joe Biden won the presidential election - now voters are giving him and his Democratic Party an interim report card. In the midterms on November 8, a new House of Representatives will be elected, along with one-third of the Senate. In the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin the political wind have shifted of late. Many voters there have grown disenchanted with President Biden's policies. That's also true for Milwaukee's Black community, which played a decisive role in the outcome of the 2020 elections. That's why campaign managers of both parties have ramped up their efforts to win over the city's African American voters. A report by Sumi Somaskanda.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #midterms2022 #blackcommunity \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

He tries flamenco dancing, tours the Alhambra, and finds his dream house on the Costa del Sol. In Tarifa, photographer Jos√© Luis Terrado shows Jaafar his photographs of refugees.\n\nFlamenco music has its roots in the south of Spain. In Las Negras, journalist Jaafar Abdul Karim meets up with flamenco performer Anabel Veloso for a dance. His Mediterranean journey then takes him into the interior of Andalusia. Throughout its history, the region has been a gateway to the Arabic-speaking world. More than 700 years of Islamic rule have left their mark, especially on the architecture. In Granada, Jaafar visits the famous Alhambra, a world heritage site.\n\nBack on the shores of the Mediterranean, the journey continues past beautiful beaches and picturesque bays to the city of M√°laga. It‚Äôs located on the \"Costa del Sol\", where the sun shines more than 300 days per year. The climate attracts millions of tourists, especially from Germany and Britain. Many have bought property here. In Estepona, Jaafar finds his dream home: the architects Jos√© Carlos Moya and Bertrand Coue have built a solar house with floor-to-ceiling windows and 360-degree panoramic views. Its unique design allows it to follow the trajectory of the sun, all day long. \n\nFinally, Jaafar heads to Tarifa, just 14 kilometers across the sea from Morocco. The proximity to the North African side of the Mediterranean has inspired the work of photographer Jos√© Luis Terrado. His pictures depict migration and the conditions under which refugees from Africa have to work in order to survive. More than any other destination on his Mediterranean journey, Andalusia shows Jaafar Abdul Karim just how closely linked Europe and Africa are, culturally as well as economically.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #andalusia #spain #mediterranean\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The nation is sinking deeper into crisis, with many people‚Äôs daily lives marred by shortages of food, medicine and electricity.\n\nCuba has been subject to sanctions for decades. Despite recent attempts at reform, the country is increasingly isolated and economically dependent. A currency reform enacted in 2021 is also causing major problems, with inflation soaring and prices skyrocketing. Food is scarce, and lines in front of the few state-run stores are getting longer and longer. \n\nPoverty is on the rise. Even the famous ingenuity of the Cuban people is reaching its limits as they try to cope with the day-to-day effects of the crisis. Images of bygone revolutionaries are fading in the streets the capital, Havana, and all over the island. Official voices continue to broadcast the state‚Äôs ideology, but ordinary people are losing hope that things will improve.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #cuba \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

It has become known for scary movies, candy, costumes and mischief. But there is a deep, universal tradition behind Halloween, also known as the Festival of the Dead, All Souls Day or Feast of the Ancestors. This festival is observed around the world, in the northern and southern hemispheres at the SAME time of year. In this video, we take a dive down the rabbit hole with Randall Carlson to uncover the mysterious origin of Halloween. \n\nRandall Carlson is a master builder and designer, a geologist, anthropologist and historian. He specializes in sacred geometry, ancient civilizations, climate and environmental change, myths, legends, cosmic cycles and catastrophes. He is a proponent of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, and has theorized about the extinction of historical advanced human civilizations. \n\nTo learn more about Randall please visit https://randallcarlson.com/\nCheck out Randall's Podcast, Kosmographia https://www.youtube.com/c/TheRandallCarlson\nTo learn about geology tours with Randall https://randallcarlson.com/\n\nSpecial thanks to the Lowell Observatory for providing some of the astronomy footage.\n\nThank you for watching.

There was many people and children living under ground hiding from the constant shelling.

Russian forces were partially enveloped cutting off resupply but not retreat. Unfortunately, most of the Ukrainian forces involved have to move on foot so the Russians were able to make a new defensive line at the Oskil river and reservoir before the Ukrainian Army could seal off avenues of retreat and clear all the pockets of Russians caught behind UA lines. Additional delays occurred because of the limited means to move forces and supplies forward.\n\nSupport Channel directly:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/willybeatingcancer\nhttps://www.paypal.me/MWilliams745\nMERCH\nhttps://willys-merch.creator-spring.com/\n\nHighlights Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDachW-2tQTAIOLDvybZbRA/featured\n\nOfficial Enquiries:\nwilliams.mattphoto@gmail.com","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/puESCu80wRA/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"3770","thumbCount":"371"},{"id":"lg5wznn3IBE","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UCY1kMZp36IQSyNx_9h4mpCg","channelName":"Mark Rober","title":"Backyard Squirrelympics 3.0- The Summer Games","published":"2022-10-23T20:00:40+00:00","updated":"2022-10-24T08:49:57+00:00","authorName":"Mark Rober","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY1kMZp36IQSyNx_9h4mpCg","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg5wznn3IBE","description":"I gave up on trying to battle my squirrels... but what if they battled each other?

Do you think their views are rooted in racism, ignorance, and intolerance? Or is it just possible that they have valid reasons for thinking the way they do? Former leftist activist and now PragerU personality Amala Ekpunobi breaks it down in PragerU‚Äôs 500th 5-Minute Video.\n\nIf you've enjoyed our 500 5-Minute Videos, please consider joining PragerU's Club5 with a donation of $5/month and help save America by contributing to our next wave of mind-changing videos: https://l.prageru.com/3eU419W\n\n#conservative #prageru #amalaekpunobi \n\nSUBSCRIBE üëâ https://www.prageru.com/join\n\nScript:\n\nWhy do you hate conservatives? Well let‚Äôs not say hate. Let‚Äôs say dislike, because you don‚Äôt really hate anyone.\n\nYou may dislike them because they want to ban abortion. Conservatives say they‚Äôre all for freedom, but when it comes to a woman‚Äôs freedom to choose what she wants to do with her own body, they sing a different tune.\n\nYou may dislike them because they oppress people of color and deny the fact that America is systemically racist. Conservatives say that everybody is equal regardless of race, and that racism has little to no effect on the daily lives of people of color. So they just ignore the issue altogether.\n\nYou may dislike them because they don‚Äôt believe in climate change. Scientists keep telling us we‚Äôre overheating the planet and conservatives don‚Äôt seem to care. They‚Äôre more concerned about profits than people. But what good is money if you have no planet to spend it on?\n\nYou may dislike them because they‚Äôre obsessed with guns. How are we ever going to stop gun violence if we don‚Äôt get guns off the streets? And how are we ever going to get guns off the streets, if conservatives block every commonsense gun law?\n\nYou may dislike them because they‚Äôre so intolerant. What‚Äôs the harm of calling somebody by their preferred pronouns? Why can‚Äôt conservatives just show some compassion instead of obsessing over every kind of behavior they don‚Äôt like?\n\nYou may dislike them because if they got their way, they‚Äôd get rid of democracy and establish an authoritarian theocracy. Bye-bye separation of church and state. Hello, fascism.\n\nAfter all that, you might sum up conservatives in one word: ugh.\n\nIf any of this resonates with you, I get it. I‚Äôve been there. But‚Äîand this surprised me‚ÄîI found they actually have reasons for thinking the way they do. \n\nHere are some of them.\n\nOn abortion: To start, we can agree that no one likes abortion. But there is a clear divide on the issue. Progressives focus their attention on the mother. Conservatives, while they have compassion for the mother, focus their attention on the baby. They see a human being growing in a mother‚Äôs womb as innocent and vulnerable. Those babies deserve to be protected, since they obviously can‚Äôt protect themselves. \n\nOn racism: Conservatives don‚Äôt deny that racist people exist, but when it comes to the narrative of systemic racism, conservatives are unconvinced. Of course there are disparities in this country, but why assume that these disparities are because of racism? Good schools, good parents, good habits, and good communities would go much further toward alleviating poverty and expanding opportunity than a lifetime of racial justice movements. By the way, these rules apply to everyone, regardless of skin color.\n\nOn climate change: Conservatives have very little faith in computer models that have been inaccurately predicting disaster for nearly half a century. Conservatives have a lot of faith, however, in human ingenuity to overcome climate. What is air conditioning but a human adaptation to the environment? See Miami or Phoenix for further reference. This is not to say we should simply do nothing. Nuclear power, for example, holds so much promise as a renewable and safe energy source. Conservatives don‚Äôt understand why environmentalists oppose it. It makes them skeptical‚Äîand suspicious‚Äîthat the real agenda behind the environmentalist movement is not saving the planet, but giving more power to the government to control people‚Äôs lives.\n\nFor the full script, visit: https://www.prageru.com/video/why-do-you-hate-conservatives","thumbnail":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/MKHSv6XiNQY/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"33786","thumbCount":"4246"},{"id":"eOLaepouGpY","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UCAPLyCPMWlJ0hZCS5-A8loA","channelName":"Maiorianus","title":"How on earth did the Vandals manage to conquer Africa?","published":"2022-10-24T12:00:51+00:00","updated":"2022-10-24T12:00:51+00:00","authorName":"Maiorianus","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAPLyCPMWlJ0hZCS5-A8loA","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOLaepouGpY","description":"üî¥ YOU WANT TO SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL? üî¥\nü§ó Join our Patreon community: https://www.patreon.com/Maiorianus\nOr become an official Maiorianus member on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/Maiorianus461/join\n\n\nü§ó One-Time Donation?\n       - PayPal: https://paypal.me/Maiorianus\n       - Bitcoin: bc1qv4lsfsplvfecrrgvmfclhga28we7mvh9563xdj\nüîó Share the video with anyone who might be interested (it helps a ton!)\nüëç Subscribe to our videos FOR FREE: https://www.youtube.com/c/Maiorianus461?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\nThe link to the excellent mod \"Age of Justinian AD 555\" for the game Rome Total War: Attila can be found here:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1836928957\n\n\nThe wonderful background music is by Adrian von Ziegler: https://youtu.be/USz9cwVSaqg\n\nüì¨ Contact us: maiorianus.sebastian@gmail.com\n#Maiorianus","thumbnail":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/eOLaepouGpY/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"6897","thumbCount":"707"},{"id":"z0CJH7SDW1M","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UC4pNDofN0Xh-z2bhh62g8Ow","channelName":"Not What You Think","title":"British Engineering #shorts","published":"2022-10-24T15:56:52+00:00","updated":"2022-10-24T16:30:34+00:00","authorName":"Not What You Think","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4pNDofN0Xh-z2bhh62g8Ow","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0CJH7SDW1M","description":"Why you hear about \"German engineering\", but not \"British engineering\", is the panjandrum, but it's #NotWhatYouThink #NWYT #shorts\n\nMusic:\nFull Momentum - Christoffer Moe Ditlevsen\n\nFootage:\nRoyal Archives","thumbnail":"https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/z0CJH7SDW1M/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"50346","thumbCount":"5343"},{"id":"tJE8HYFrkT4","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","channelName":"Jordan B Peterson","title":"Psychedelic Science | Dr. Dennis McKenna | #299","published":"2022-10-24T20:30:05+00:00","updated":"2022-10-24T20:30:05+00:00","authorName":"Jordan B Peterson","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJE8HYFrkT4","description":"Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Dr. Dennis McKenna discuss the science behind psychedelics, the entities found through the looking glass, the current pharmaceutical approach to long life, and why it needs to change.\n\nDr. Dennis McKenna is an American ethnopharmacologist, lecturer and author. He is a founding board member and the director of ethnopharmacology at the Heffter Research Institute, a non-profit exploring the therapeutic uses of psychedelic medicines. McKenna received his masters in botany at the University of Hawaii in 1979, followed by his doctorate in the same field at the University of British Columbia in 1984. Dennis is the brother of Terrence McKenna, a cultural figure and proponent for the exploration of psychedelics. Together they co-authored The Invisible Landscape. Much later Dennis would write a memoir, Brotherhood of the Screaming Abyss,  detailing he and his brothers exploits in the field. Today, Dennis tours and lectures, while also running the  Mckenna Academy of Natural Philosophy, which seeks to uncover the mysteries of consciousness held within the realm of botany and pharmacology.\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n‚ÄîLinks‚Äî \n\nMcKenna Academy: https://mckenna.academy\n\nThe Experiment at La Chorrera https://mckenna.academy/events?id=32 \n\nESPD55 Livestream Symposium ESPD55.com\n\nThose interested in donations may contact connect@mckenna.academy\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nBirch Gold - Text \"JORDAN\" to 989898 for your no-cost, no-obligation, FREE information kit\n\nElysium Health - Save 25% off Basis monthly subscriptions with code JBP25: https://trybasis.com/Jordan\n\nShopify - Get a FREE 14-day trial with full access to Shopify's entire suite of features: https://shopify.com/jbp\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(0:40) intro\n(2:33) Dr. Dennis McKenna now\n(6:47) What is ethnopharmacology?\n(12:45) Ayahuasca\n(26:02) Hierarchy of concepts\n(30:00) The Reality Hallucination\n(43:50) Breaking down hyper reality \n(49:30) Commonalities of entities\n(55:50) The intrinsic form of personality\n(1:00:15) Ritual, bad shamans\n(1:02:58) Carl Rogers, voluntary exposure\n(1:09:15) Roland Griffiths, the flaw in how medicine is practiced\n(1:12:05) Impending mortality\n(1:24:45) Dr. McKenna‚Äôs future plans\n(1:26:19) Looking back at a life long career \n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus #podcast #DennisMcKenna #psychedelics #science #drugs","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/tJE8HYFrkT4/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"44971","thumbCount":"2904"},{"id":"DVZec56Z2yQ","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","channelName":"Jordan B Peterson","title":"Little Winnie","published":"2022-10-24T18:27:13+00:00","updated":"2022-10-24T19:12:20+00:00","authorName":"Jordan B Peterson","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVZec56Z2yQ","description":"Order here: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/abc-of-childhood-tragedy/\n\nWickedly penned by Dr. Jordan B Peterson, an ABC of Childhood Tragedy unforgettably depicts the doomed and desperate lives of Adella, Bertram, Cynthia and their cohort of catastrophe. Twenty-six dark and witty poems, each a tragic comedy of innocence and vulnerability. Twenty-six hauntingly beautiful portrayals of injustice and suffering, each from the gifted imagination of Juliette Fogra, illustrator of Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life. If A Nightmare before Christmas or Coraline struck you to the heart, if the gothic raillery of Edward Gorey‚Äôs Gashlycrumb Tinies seduced you to smile satirically, if the Brothers Grimm were nowhere near grim enough for you, then An ABC of Childhood Tragedy might just be the book you‚Äôve been pining for. Most decidedly NOT for children.
