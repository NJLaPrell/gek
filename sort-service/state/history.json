The first 100 people to download Endel by clicking the link below will get a free week of audio experiences! https://app.adjust.com/b8wxub6?campaign=invicta_october2022&adgroup=youtube\n\nIn this Units of History Documentary we turn to the isles of Britannia and their War Chariots. To the Romans, these represented an exotic and ancient way of fighting which dated back to the Bronze Age and stories of the Trojan War. In this video we seek to shed light on their history.\n\nThe documentary begins with a discussion of the origins of the War Chariots of Brittania. This had its roots in the spread of chariots across the celtic world. Yet while this trend would die out in the mainland around the 3rd century BC, it would live on in the relative isolation of the British Isles. Thus it was that when Julius Caesar first launched an expedition onto the island he would be surprised to find hundreds of these war chariots bearing down upon him. \n\nBased on the records of he and other historians, we are able to present a reconstruction of the equipment, training, and tactics of these war chariots. Even though the Romans saw them as relics of the past, they nonetheless feared and admired them for their ability to mix the mobility of cavalry with the staying power of infantry.\n\nWe then go on to cover the service history of these War Chariots of Britannia. This would begin with Julius Caesars invasion of Britain where they fought in both pitched and guerilla style battles. The largest of these encounters was the the Battle of the River Medway which lasted two days. Next the war chariots would be encountered during Claudius invasion of Britain and in the ensuing Boudicca's Rebellion. They helped run down the ninth legion and likely featured in the Battle of Watling street. The last major instance of war chariots taking the field would be in the Roman Invasion of Scotland where they were deployed en-masse at the Battle of Mons Graupius.\n\nWhat Units of History should we cover next?

Officers were told the wanted male was in the area of West Martin Street. The officers contacted an individual, identified as 29-year-old Alejandro Vitela on a bicycle who matched the description of the suspect in the 3200 block of West Martin Street. \n\nThe first officer exited the patrol vehicle and approached Vitela. Vitela refused to provide his full name, and as the officer went to detain Vitela, he began to resist. Vitela told the officer, ‚ÄúI have a gun, I‚Äôm gonna shoot you\" and reached toward his waistband. One officer deployed his service weapon and fired multiple times, striking Vitela. Vitela was pronounced deceased at the scene.

The next stop in our series is Israel. With a fascinating and beautiful Mediterranean coastline, this nation is home to Jews, Muslims and Christians.\n\nIt‚Äôs Sineb El Masrar‚Äôs first time in Israel. In Tel Aviv, the journalist visits a synagogue serving a conservative community, and meets cantor Romina Reisin. In Jewish houses of worship, this role is traditionally reserved for men; Romina Reisin is an exception to that rule.\n\nThe journey continues to Acre, or Akko as it known locally, once a powerful port city. There are traces of the Ottoman Empire everywhere here, including at a 1,500-year-old palace lovingly restored and operated as a hotel by its owner Uri Jeremias. On the way to Haifa, Sineb meets Boris Libermann, head of engineering at the Hadera Desalination Plant, one of the country‚Äôs largest. He explains how the tiny desert nation aims to combat chronic water shortages.\n\nMost of the nation‚Äôs Muslims live in Haifa. Sineb is especially interested in the reformist Ahmadiyya community. Imam Muhammad Sharif Odeh explains how Jews and Muslims can coexist peacefully.\n\nSineb El Masrar talks to the Moroccan-born singer Neta Elkayam about their shared experience - growing up in a foreign country; and attends a concert by the musician held in Haifa‚Äôs Old Town. With familiar melodies still ringing in her ears, she sets off the next day for the West Bank. Together with \"Rabbis for Human Rights\", she pitches in to help a Palestinian family with the harvesting. This organization of Jewish rabbis is committed to improving human rights for all, regardless of faith, nationality and gender.\n\nSeries playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLovlAKbQVz6CUAih30DqjUx1HKcxhx4jF\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

But how seriously should we take any artist's politics? A conversation with the host of The Re-Education podcast.\n\nFull text and links: https://reason.com/video/2022/10/13/should-anyone-be-offended-by-kanye-west-live-with-eli-lake/\n-\nYe‚Äîbetter known as Kanye West‚Äîis one of the great artists at work in contemporary America. But as brilliant as he is in a recording studio or on a fashion runway, he's equally prone to making outrageous, often-cryptic political statements, not to mention weird threats to former wife Kim Kardashian's former boyfriend Pete Davidson. He has very publicly struggled with mental health issues even as he continues to produce highly praised music and clothing.\n\nIn 2018, he suggested that 400 years of African American slavery \"sounds like a choice\" and just this week his declaration that he was about to go \"death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE\" led to his Twitter and Instagram accounts being locked. In a recent, wide-ranging interview with Fox News' Tucker Carlson, Ye was personable, loquacious, and engaging, even as he suggested the fat acceptance movement was a type of \"genocide of the Black race\" and defended wearing a \"White Lives Matter\" shirt at his latest fashion show. He also talked about ideological orthodoxy in the entertainment industry, saying that it \"drove me crazy not to be able to say I liked Trump.\"\n\nIs Ye a victim of a woke culture that he says attacks anyone \"presenting new ideas?\" Or is he the latest in a line of major artists--such as Picasso, T.S. Eliot, Alice Walker--whose personal lives or politics are beyond the pale? Should audiences separate artists from their art or should audiences dismiss them if they hold repellent views?\n\nReason's Nick Gillespie and Natalie Dowzicky discuss all this and more with Commentary and New York Sun columnist Eli Lake, host of The Re-Education podcast and a Ye super-fan."},{"id":"4LndTfQGXUU","channelId":"UCbyE5OvaP4GJhKvPCXxjWvw","channelName":"Fire of Learning","title":"Skinwalker Ranch  - The Full Story | Documentary","published":"2022-10-13T00:55:23+00:00","updated":"2022-10-13T12:36:19+00:00","description":"A ranch in Utah has, ever since it was first reported on in 1996, been regarded as one of the most significant hotspots of paranormal activity in the entire world.

The paramilitary Azov Battalion component formed in 2014 before integrating into the Ukrainian National Guard as a Special Purposes Regiment. Following integration, Azov Regiment veterans broadened the movement to include a political wing, National Corps, and a paramilitary wing, National Militia. It is notable for its recruitment of far-right foreign fighters from the U.S., Russia, and Europe, as well as extensive transnational ties with other far-right organizations.

The technician didn't mention if the headlights were salvageable or not. \n0:23 The technician said: \"customer drove the car in and in the middle of the parking lot her wheel fell off. We jacked up the right front and pulled it into the shop and found the bearings had been gone for a long time, replaced the front brakes & caliper, hub, and knuckle and the wheel as well had been ground down, brake pads are long gone and are probably in someone's tire.\"\n0:37 The technician doesn't know yet if his dealership took this vehicle on trade-in yet. Looks like they were driving on the spare tire. So most likely, they didn't have another spare so kept driving. \n0:49 The technician said: \"2019 Toyota Camry TAXI came in for a recall. The customer didn't mention anything about all the lights on (check engine, Collison, TPMS ) had to boost the car. He says just do the recall as I'm going to sell it.\" \n1:03 As shown the lower ball joint is broken into two pieces. From the look's of it, the customer might have hit something which snapped it in half. Could be that it was wear and tear as well since you can't see any grease in the ball joint (but I've never seen that before).\n1:15 The customer didn't order the correct wheels with the correct offset. So in this case the customer could order some wheel spacers, or buy the correct wheels with the correct offset. As you see in the clip, the backside of the wheel/spokes is rubbing against the brake caliper and that's why the customer's car couldn't move. \n1:25 The technician has no clue why the customer has different wheels/brakes. Maybe they got some used parts from a scrap yard.\n1:35 It seems to be a common issue, and Mazda has a TSB (Technical Service Bulletin) regarding this issue. More info here - https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/tsbs/2018/MC-10143977-9999.pdf\n1:41 Seen this happen to a lot of these Chrysler vans. It seems to be common to see the strut towers rust out and strut mounts fail.\n1:50 No extra info.\n2:06 No extra info from the viewer who sent this in. However, it definitely needs a tire and I'm sure the other 3 need to be replaced as well. \n2:15 People add body mounts to their vehicle to lift up the body (cab and box/bed in this case) so they can most likely fit bigger tires. This is a cheaper way instead of doing a lift kit that costs more. This one the customer did doesn't look to safe and you probably can't put much weight in the bed/box anymore.\n2:25 The technician said: \"Customer is willing to pay 4 hours labor to remove the forbidden goo plus one hour for R&I window regulator motor. They just moved to Florida from Colorado and didn't understand how hot and humid it REALLY is here. Window regulator motor shot due to forbidden goo interfering with window regulator motor. Instructed customer to replace deadening material with different material. \nUpdate II: Front passenger window also inop. due to the same reason. The customer has agreed to pay me double to do both doors and window regulators. Extra time later to remove all deadening material on other doors and replace with something more suitable for the Florida heat and humidity.\" \nThe customer used Stinger Roadkill which they bought online. \n2:45 The viewer who shared this said the shop is a quick walk from his home so that's probably why they didn't come off. The shop was apologetic and felt really bad, refunded the money, and redid the alignment.\n2:54 After a long hard day, clocking out causes some excitement.\n3:09 Outro.

Nine months later, after Eric was forced to burn through his life savings, The Big Board is open and the outstanding fines have been dismissed. But Eric and Robert are fighting on in defense of the fundamentally American principles at stake. Their new legal challenge argues that the DC government did not have the authority to issue a string of emergency orders that resulted in The Big Board‚Äôs shutdown, and that these actions, by seeking to evade congressional review and judicial scrutiny, violated the U.S. Constitution and the Home Rule Act of 1973.\n\nWatch Free the People's documentary coverage of this story:\nShut Down Indefinitely | Part 1: https://youtu.be/hA-iPTXJfQE\nShut Down Indefinitely | Part 2: https://youtu.be/OWAa7P8DmBI\n\nWatch Kibbe on Liberty on BlazeTV: https://blazetv.com/kibbe\nFollow Kibbe on Liberty on Facebook: https://facebook.com/KibbeBlazeTV\nFollow Free the People on YouTube: https://youtube.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Twitter: https://twitter.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Instagram: https://instagram.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Facebook: https://facebook.com/freethepeople\nVisit Free the People's Website: https://freethepeople.org\n\nKibbe on Liberty is a weekly podcast with libertarian author, economist, and community organizer Matt Kibbe.

During the stop, Officer Lau learned Garcia had an extraditable warrant from Texas and took her into custody. After Gladstone Sgt. Travis Hill arrived to the scene, Garcia told officers she was concerned about her two pit bulls alone at her home. Officers agreed to stop at her home on the way to jail to secure her dogs for Clackamas County Dog Control. The officers arrived at the home with Garcia. She was in handcuffs at the time. They enter the home through the garage and the dogs rushed out. The dogs barked at the officers, one growling. Garcia recommends getting leashes for her pets. With her hands behind her back and in handcuffs, Garcia walked upstairs to get a leash. Garcia drew Sgt. Hill‚Äôs attention away from her for a moment and was able to grab a 9mm semi-automatic handgun from a nearby nightstand. \n\nGarcia said she would not go back to jail and then shot Sgt. Hill in the lower leg. The two officers then exchanged gunfire with Garcia, yelling at her multiple times to drop the gun. Moments later, backup arrives, and Officer Lau rushed in to help his partner. Garcia was hit in the torso multiples times and taken to the hospital for treatment. Officer Lau was not injured, but Sgt. Hill was shot in the leg and grazed on the arm. Hill‚Äôs leg wound caused permanent injury and he left law enforcement. On. October 12, 2022, Clackamas County Circuit Judge Cody M. Weston sentenced Garcia to 10 years in prison, the maximum sentence allowed for attempted aggravated murder under Oregon law. She is also required to pay Hill a $50,000 compensatory fine for injuries that caused permanent injury.

Put simply, the  day dreamers who normally sat at the back of  the class now became viable options for military service, to be followed by a few years of brutal combat operations overseas.  The Authorities would find it more convenient looking the other way when someone failed an English paper if they can now be shipped off to fight on the front line of Vietnam.\n\n2nd Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPdc6bs3I8s6Y4QE_3g3MZw\nBecome a Simple History member: https://www.youtube.com/simplehistory/join\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/simplehistory\n\nCopyright: DO NOT translate and re-upload our content on Youtube or other social media.\n\nSIMPLE HISTORY MERCHANDISE \n\nGet the Simple History books on Amazon: \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Turner-%60/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\nT-Shirts\n\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/simple-history-official-merch\n\nSimple history gives you the facts, simple!\n\nSee the book collection here:\n\nAmazon USA\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Turner/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\n\nAmazon UK\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Daniel-Turner/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Simple-History-549437675141192/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SimpleHistoryYT\n\n\nCredit:\nCreated by Daniel Turner (B.A. (Hons) in History, University College London) \nScript: \nNatasha Martell\nLuke Ursone\n\nNarrator:\n\nChris Kane\nhttps://vocalforge.com/"},{"id":"JvCqticDEYE","channelId":"UCvQ2kejN6UkrEVhE5oiYwBw","channelName":"GOP War Room","title":"These Georgia Moms Are Supporting Republican Herschel Walker Due To ‚ÄúOut-Of-Control Crime‚Äù","published":"2022-10-14T16:05:30+00:00","updated":"2022-10-14T16:06:50+00:00","description":""},{"id":"sNmFsJ7sylw","channelId":"UCdeMVChrumySxV9N1w0Au-w","channelName":"The Duran","title":"Kwarteng gone.
