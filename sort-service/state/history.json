A woman apparently told responding officers that her son, 29-year-old Tyler Patrick, was acting delusional and banging on the house. Officers spoke with Patrick inside the residence and determined that he should be taken to a local hospital. As one officer, later identified as Off. George Kloos, tried to walk Patrick out of the residence, he swung a concealed [pocket] knife at the officer and stabbed Kloos in the neck. \n\nPatrick then attempted to stab two other officers as they tackled him onto a couch. Officers “wrestled” the knife out of his hand and took him into custody. Patrick was taken to the hospital for minor injuries he suffered during his arrest. He was treated, released and booked in the Montgomery County Jail. Patrick is facing three counts of felonious assault of a peace officer. Patrick appeared in court Friday afternoon where his bond was set at $500,000. He’s set to appear in court next on October 24, 2022. Officer Kloos, 10-year veteran of the force, was taken to Miami Valley Hospital and was released later that day. Doctors said the knife somehow missed the arteries in his neck. He is now home, and expected to make a full recovery.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nSpecial thanks to Shout-Out Supporters on Patreon:\n- Charles Cooper\n- Joe\n- Cooper Malley\n- Luis Perez\n- Chris Wesley\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity","thumbnail":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/UZ-jkQs3EvQ/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"268871","thumbCount":"8870"},{"id":"f6263LFJfuc","channelId":"UCc-0YpRpqgA5lPTpSQ5uo-Q","channelName":"Audit the Audit","title":"When Not Showing Your Receipt Goes HORRIBLY Wrong","published":"2022-10-17T13:00:22+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T13:00:22+00:00","authorName":"Audit the Audit","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-0YpRpqgA5lPTpSQ5uo-Q","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6263LFJfuc","description":"Second Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClTjur-9cx8Bb4MW8r0K6xw\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/audittheaudit\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AuditTheAudit\n\nSubmit your videos here: auditheaudit@gmail.com\n\nSponsorship inquiries: audit@ellify.com\n\nWelcome to Audit the Audit, where we sort out the who and what and the right and wrong of police interactions.

This is before as well, the technician, unfortunately, didn't have a clip of it afterward. \n0:23 Close to 110 psi / 7.5 bar in this tire that should only have around 3-35 psi. The tire light will still be on if the tires are overfilled.\n0:31 The technician said: \"All she told us is that she ran off the road and it wasn't at a bad angle so she didn't know why the airbags went off. We said that she had to have it so close to rolling over, the SDM thought it was rolling and deployed the airbags. Hard to get the full story out of a lot of these customers.\"\n0:46 The lower control arm was damaged (bent), the strut was completely broken and the tire had sidewall damage. The technician was driving it out of the after he quoted the repairs. \n1:02 The technician said this somehow drove in as well. The idler arm wasn't bolted to the center link, missing cotter pins and the toe was off due to the tie rod ends not being installed correctly.\n1:26 Bushings that needed to be replaced were for the lateral arms and transmission mount. The customer finally got them replaced as their \"fix\" didn't fix the clunking noise. The first time the customer declined repairs as they said they didn't like the quote. \n1:37 The technician said he has never seen this before and doesn't know what caused this as there seems to be no impact damage. As well these are the original steel wheels (OEM). \n1:53 The battery is too big so the battery posts touch the underneath of the hood which causes the sparks.\n2:00 A Toyota badge, Subaru wheel caps, and Scion steering wheel. \nThe technician it was actually a Scion FR-S\n2:13 The technician said: \"I don't know I never got the full story. The crazy thing is that truck was driven in like that. I quoted a new lower control arm, rotor, hub(it was obviously bent but you can't see that in the video but when you rotate the hub you can see the run out with just your eye), c/v boots (the outer boot was torn and slinging grease), brake line, and front strut assembly.  I also told the service writer there may be other parts messed up (steering knuckle or possibly upper control arm as well) and that I wouldn't be able to tell until I got the rest of it fixed and on the alignment machine.\"\n2:24 Surprising to see this in a company vehicle. The technician thinks it's wired like this so the person who drives this company vehicle can quickly/easily remove it if needed. What a terrible wiring job though!\n3:01 Not sure if the deer (doe) was okay or not since it ran away.\nThe viewer who shared this said it's something you would never believe if you didn't see it on camera. He said if he has time/remembers, he will give us an update. \n3:15 Outro.

They didn’t want to install a new one of their own making. So how did the Framers ensure that the President would have enough power to be an effective chief executive, without making him a dictator? John Yoo, Professor of Law at the University of California, Berkeley, has the answer.\n\n#prageru #president #constitution #history #americanhistory \n\nSUBSCRIBE 👉 https://www.prageru.com/join\n\nScript:\n\nHow much power should we give to the President? This was one of the most vexing (and critical) questions facing the Framers of the United States Constitution in the summer of 1787. \n\nTo be effective, the President had to be perceived—both in times of war and peace—as the leader of the nation. For this to happen, he would have to be given significant authority. Americans learned this lesson in the years following the Revolutionary War when the nation floundered under the Articles of Confederation which had no provision for a chief executive.\n\nBut this chief executive couldn’t be made so strong that he could become a tyrant. Americans fought a long and bloody war to get rid of one tyrant, the English King, George III. Nobody wanted to install a new one in his place. \n\nThe Framers answer is found in Article II.\n\nThe opening sentence reads as follows: “[t]he executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States.” This might sound straightforward, but it was anything but. \n\nHere’s why.\n\n“The vesting clause” of Article II, as it’s known, differs significantly from the vesting clause of Article I, which concerns the powers of Congress—the House of Representatives and the Senate. Article I’s vesting clause states: “all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States…” It then goes on to list those limited powers. That’s it. Congress can’t do anything else. \n\nThere are no such limitations specified in Article II. The difference is subtle, but important. \n\nWhereas Congress is given specific responsibilities, the President is given broad responsibilities and wide discretion as to how he fulfills them. This is part of his executive authority.\n\nAnd just what is that executive authority?\n\nThis is spelled out in Sections 2 and 3. \n\nThe President is the commander in chief of the armed services. He sets military policy. \n\nHe makes treaties with foreign countries. He sets foreign policy.\n\nHe appoints his own advisors—what became known as his cabinet. He sets domestic policy. \n\nHe appoints judges to the Supreme Court. That obviously gives him a big say in judicial policy.\n\nAnd finally, “he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” \n\nThis list is at once brief and vast because there’s so much involved in all these duties. Indeed, the President stands at the head of the entire administrative apparatus of the Federal government with all the rights and responsibilities that entails. For example, if the President can appoint federal officials, it stands to reason that he must be able to fire them, too. \n\nWhen you realize that enforcing the law involves layers and layers of people from department heads to federal law enforcement to government lawyers, all of whom are accountable to the President, you start to grasp how much power the chief executive has. \n\nSo, how did the Framers keep the President in check? \n\nFirst and foremost, they gave Congress “the power of the purse,” the power to fund the operations of the federal government. Congress can restrain the President by withholding funding. \n\nThe President literally can’t buy a light bulb for a lamp in the Oval Office without a Congressional appropriation. If the President proposes to add a new federal agency or to launch a war, Congress can bring his plans to a halt simply by refusing to fund them.  \n\nThe Constitution strikes a similar balance in foreign affairs. The President, as Commander-in-Chief, controls the strategy, tactics, and deployments of the U.S. Armed Forces, and also dictates U.S. foreign policy. Only Congress, however, has the power to declare war, and the Senate, by a two-thirds majority, must consent to any treaty negotiated by the President.\n\nCongress also has the power to impeach the President in cases of serious misconduct—treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. But the bar for impeachment is set very high to protect the President’s independence from Congress.\n\nFor the full script, visit: https://www.prageru.com/video/the-constitution-presidential-powers","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/ThKD3Py1HvA/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"3304","thumbCount":"781"},{"id":"OmMj5A0rquo","channelId":"UCdC0An4ZPNr_YiFiYoVbwaw","channelName":"Daily Dose Of Internet","title":"Halloween Decorations are Fighting Back","published":"2022-10-17T19:59:29+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T19:59:29+00:00","authorName":"Daily Dose Of Internet","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdC0An4ZPNr_YiFiYoVbwaw","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmMj5A0rquo","description":"Hello everyone, this is YOUR Daily Dose of Internet.

Peterson, Jonathan Pageau, and Mohammed Hijab discuss comparative religion, what is said about Islam versus what Islam has to say, and how the uncomfortable conversation - whether contentious or unnerving, is well worth having. \n \nMohammed Hijab is an author, comparative religionist, and philosopher of scripture. He is the co-founder of the Sapience Institute and is a researcher and instructor for the organization. He has a BA in Politics and a master’s degree in History. He has also acquired a second master’s in Islamic Studies from the School of Oriental and African Studies, as well as a third master’s degree in Applied Theology from the University of Oxford. Currently, he is working toward his PhD in Philosophy of Religion. Having completed Islamic seminary courses, he is one of very few Muslims who has been given formal permission to relay Islamic knowledge on selected Islamic fields, dealing with comparative, political, and theological issues. In his efforts, he has amassed a substantial following on YouTube, aided in part by authoring books such as “The Scientific Deception of the New Atheists.”\n \nJonathan Pageau is a French-Canadian liturgical artist and icon carver, known for his work featured in museums across the world. He carves Eastern Orthodox and other traditional images and teaches an online carving class. He also runs a YouTube channel dedicated to the exploration of symbolism across history and religion.\n \n________________________________________________________________________\n\n—Links— \n\nFor

When the government shut him down for refusing to discriminate against his unvaccinated customers, the D.C. government shut him down and took all that away. After a nine-month legal battle, Eric has been allowed to reopen, but he’s continue to push the courts to acknowledge that what the city did was illegal so that it will that much harder for future administrations to deprive Americans of their basic rights of association, assembly, speech, and due process in the future.\n\nWatch Kibbe on Liberty on BlazeTV: https://blazetv.com/kibbe\nFollow Kibbe on Liberty on Facebook: https://facebook.com/KibbeBlazeTV\nFollow Free the People on YouTube: https://youtube.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Twitter: https://twitter.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Instagram: https://instagram.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Facebook: https://facebook.com/freethepeople\nVisit Free the People's Website: https://freethepeople.org\n\nKibbe on Liberty is a weekly podcast with libertarian author, economist, and community organizer Matt Kibbe. As the president of Free the People, Kibbe has decades of experience in the libertarian political sphere, but in these troubled times he believes that open dialogue is needed to bring people together. This means being willing to talk, and especially listen, to those with whom we might not always agree, trying to understand perspectives that might otherwise be foreign to us.\n\nKibbe on Liberty's growing roster of guests includes politicians, economists, comedians, writers, radio personalities, activists, journalists, and even a magician or two—with topics of conversation ranging from current affairs to craft beer and the Grateful Dead. So grab a cold one, and settle in for the next hour of Kibbe on Liberty, mostly honest conversations with mostly interesting people.","thumbnail":"https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/6CfoR0GDsRc/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"56","thumbCount":"8"},{"id":"9L36DuQb3LY","channelId":"UCyKgD0DLtBN21gfThSalyUQ","channelName":"Melissa Dougherty","title":"If Modern Vegans Acted Like Progressive Christians.","published":"2022-10-17T13:40:31+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T13:40:33+00:00","authorName":"Melissa Dougherty","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyKgD0DLtBN21gfThSalyUQ","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L36DuQb3LY","description":"It's impossible to be certain what vegans actually believe.

It has traditionally been a place where socialist left heavyweights could thrive, and burgeoning trade unions could flourish. \n\nSince the panic-stricken derailing of the Corbyn project and the mass expulsions and rule changes that brought with it, there is no longer any chance of a functioning left in the Labour party. \n\nThere’s no chance of even a nominal pushback of the prevailing state orthodoxy and nor will there ever be, again! Those still hoping any meaningful ground can be gained or that Starmer will be replaced by another Corbyn, are fooling themselves. \n\nOn the other hand, there are those who cling to the Labour ‘brand’, because it can still get them elected. We aim to change that! Anyone serious about challenging neoliberal state imperialism needs to bid a fond farewell to the lost Labour Party, brush themselves off, and come out fighting!","thumbnail":"https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/_JDZMeSxpA8/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"628","thumbCount":"94"},{"id":"OvMBRF43C7Y","channelId":"UCf_HItERkRB3vnkWt2RSOLg","channelName":"George Galloway","title":"FULL INTERVIEW:There’s not much that’s democratic or equitable about the #UN","published":"2022-10-17T16:00:20+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T16:00:20+00:00","authorName":"George Galloway","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf_HItERkRB3vnkWt2RSOLg","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvMBRF43C7Y","description":"\"FULL INTERVIEW: #Nato is not a defence alliance.

If you haven't seen Seasons 1 & 2, search \"The Chosen\" wherever you get your apps and on your streaming devices.\n \n“Come to me, you who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.” That's the theme of Season 3, and man, that applied to those of us making the show as well. It's taken a long time for Season 3 to get here, and believe me, it wasn't by choice. From supply chain issues affecting our construction, to Covid delays, to weather, the making of Season 3 for sure made us weary and heavy-laden. We don't get to escape the themes of each season.\n \nBut as you'll see from this trailer, I believe it was worth it. We launch Season Three in theaters, with Episodes 1 & 2 coming to most English-speaking countries on November 18 for a limited run on the big screen. And don't worry, if you can't see it in theaters, you'll soon after get it free and easy on streaming. So what are you going to see?\n \nSeason Three picks up where Season Two left off (you should watch that season if you haven't-—I promise Season Three will make more sense), with Jesus delivering the most famous sermon in history. What follows are the consequences of living out his teachings. The world changes because of this sermon, and the believers in (and enemies of) Jesus increase exponentially. This creates confusion, chaos, and yes, doubt, and we don't gloss over any of that in this season. I assure you, you're going to see some tough questions asked that you've no doubt experienced yourself. But...\n \nHe gives rest.\n \nThank you for your patience with this season. The good news is, while you've been waiting, literally tens of millions of people around the world have discovered The Chosen, and we are optimistic Season 3 will enlarge this movement even more. Be sure to watch this entire trailer for all the info you'll need to experience Season 3.

In this interview on Conversations That Matter with The New American magazine's Alex Newman, Rubacek describes her interviews with numerous sources in China--both victims and perpetrators--and how she stumbled upon the term \"Walking Dead\" used to describe the individuals who perpetrate these ghastly atrocities against their fellow human beings. Her new book examines how human beings could inflict such evil on others. Her new movie, meanwhile, focuses on providing hope. Rubacek hopes America will learn from the horrors of Communist China, as she warns that the United States could--in a worst-case scenario--end up like China. \n\n🇺🇸 The New

A woman apparently told responding officers that her son, 29-year-old Tyler Patrick, was acting delusional and banging on the house. Officers spoke with Patrick inside the residence and determined that he should be taken to a local hospital. As one officer, later identified as Off. George Kloos, tried to walk Patrick out of the residence, he swung a concealed [pocket] knife at the officer and stabbed Kloos in the neck. \n\nPatrick then attempted to stab two other officers as they tackled him onto a couch. Officers “wrestled” the knife out of his hand and took him into custody. Patrick was taken to the hospital for minor injuries he suffered during his arrest. He was treated, released and booked in the Montgomery County Jail. Patrick is facing three counts of felonious assault of a peace officer. Patrick appeared in court Friday afternoon where his bond was set at $500,000. He’s set to appear in court next on October 24, 2022. Officer Kloos, 10-year veteran of the force, was taken to Miami Valley Hospital and was released later that day. Doctors said the knife somehow missed the arteries in his neck. He is now home, and expected to make a full recovery.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nSpecial thanks to Shout-Out Supporters on Patreon:\n- Charles Cooper\n- Joe\n- Cooper Malley\n- Luis Perez\n- Chris Wesley\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity","thumbnail":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/UZ-jkQs3EvQ/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"268871","thumbCount":"8870"},{"id":"f6263LFJfuc","channelId":"UCc-0YpRpqgA5lPTpSQ5uo-Q","channelName":"Audit the Audit","title":"When Not Showing Your Receipt Goes HORRIBLY Wrong","published":"2022-10-17T13:00:22+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T13:00:22+00:00","authorName":"Audit the Audit","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-0YpRpqgA5lPTpSQ5uo-Q","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6263LFJfuc","description":"Second Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClTjur-9cx8Bb4MW8r0K6xw\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/audittheaudit\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AuditTheAudit\n\nSubmit your videos here: auditheaudit@gmail.com\n\nSponsorship inquiries: audit@ellify.com\n\nWelcome to Audit the Audit, where we sort out the who and what and the right and wrong of police interactions.

This is before as well, the technician, unfortunately, didn't have a clip of it afterward. \n0:23 Close to 110 psi / 7.5 bar in this tire that should only have around 3-35 psi. The tire light will still be on if the tires are overfilled.\n0:31 The technician said: \"All she told us is that she ran off the road and it wasn't at a bad angle so she didn't know why the airbags went off. We said that she had to have it so close to rolling over, the SDM thought it was rolling and deployed the airbags. Hard to get the full story out of a lot of these customers.\"\n0:46 The lower control arm was damaged (bent), the strut was completely broken and the tire had sidewall damage. The technician was driving it out of the after he quoted the repairs. \n1:02 The technician said this somehow drove in as well. The idler arm wasn't bolted to the center link, missing cotter pins and the toe was off due to the tie rod ends not being installed correctly.\n1:26 Bushings that needed to be replaced were for the lateral arms and transmission mount. The customer finally got them replaced as their \"fix\" didn't fix the clunking noise. The first time the customer declined repairs as they said they didn't like the quote. \n1:37 The technician said he has never seen this before and doesn't know what caused this as there seems to be no impact damage. As well these are the original steel wheels (OEM). \n1:53 The battery is too big so the battery posts touch the underneath of the hood which causes the sparks.\n2:00 A Toyota badge, Subaru wheel caps, and Scion steering wheel. \nThe technician it was actually a Scion FR-S\n2:13 The technician said: \"I don't know I never got the full story. The crazy thing is that truck was driven in like that. I quoted a new lower control arm, rotor, hub(it was obviously bent but you can't see that in the video but when you rotate the hub you can see the run out with just your eye), c/v boots (the outer boot was torn and slinging grease), brake line, and front strut assembly.  I also told the service writer there may be other parts messed up (steering knuckle or possibly upper control arm as well) and that I wouldn't be able to tell until I got the rest of it fixed and on the alignment machine.\"\n2:24 Surprising to see this in a company vehicle. The technician thinks it's wired like this so the person who drives this company vehicle can quickly/easily remove it if needed. What a terrible wiring job though!\n3:01 Not sure if the deer (doe) was okay or not since it ran away.\nThe viewer who shared this said it's something you would never believe if you didn't see it on camera. He said if he has time/remembers, he will give us an update. \n3:15 Outro.

They didn’t want to install a new one of their own making. So how did the Framers ensure that the President would have enough power to be an effective chief executive, without making him a dictator? John Yoo, Professor of Law at the University of California, Berkeley, has the answer.\n\n#prageru #president #constitution #history #americanhistory \n\nSUBSCRIBE 👉 https://www.prageru.com/join\n\nScript:\n\nHow much power should we give to the President? This was one of the most vexing (and critical) questions facing the Framers of the United States Constitution in the summer of 1787. \n\nTo be effective, the President had to be perceived—both in times of war and peace—as the leader of the nation. For this to happen, he would have to be given significant authority. Americans learned this lesson in the years following the Revolutionary War when the nation floundered under the Articles of Confederation which had no provision for a chief executive.\n\nBut this chief executive couldn’t be made so strong that he could become a tyrant. Americans fought a long and bloody war to get rid of one tyrant, the English King, George III. Nobody wanted to install a new one in his place. \n\nThe Framers answer is found in Article II.\n\nThe opening sentence reads as follows: “[t]he executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States.” This might sound straightforward, but it was anything but. \n\nHere’s why.\n\n“The vesting clause” of Article II, as it’s known, differs significantly from the vesting clause of Article I, which concerns the powers of Congress—the House of Representatives and the Senate. Article I’s vesting clause states: “all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States…” It then goes on to list those limited powers. That’s it. Congress can’t do anything else. \n\nThere are no such limitations specified in Article II. The difference is subtle, but important. \n\nWhereas Congress is given specific responsibilities, the President is given broad responsibilities and wide discretion as to how he fulfills them. This is part of his executive authority.\n\nAnd just what is that executive authority?\n\nThis is spelled out in Sections 2 and 3. \n\nThe President is the commander in chief of the armed services. He sets military policy. \n\nHe makes treaties with foreign countries. He sets foreign policy.\n\nHe appoints his own advisors—what became known as his cabinet. He sets domestic policy. \n\nHe appoints judges to the Supreme Court. That obviously gives him a big say in judicial policy.\n\nAnd finally, “he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” \n\nThis list is at once brief and vast because there’s so much involved in all these duties. Indeed, the President stands at the head of the entire administrative apparatus of the Federal government with all the rights and responsibilities that entails. For example, if the President can appoint federal officials, it stands to reason that he must be able to fire them, too. \n\nWhen you realize that enforcing the law involves layers and layers of people from department heads to federal law enforcement to government lawyers, all of whom are accountable to the President, you start to grasp how much power the chief executive has. \n\nSo, how did the Framers keep the President in check? \n\nFirst and foremost, they gave Congress “the power of the purse,” the power to fund the operations of the federal government. Congress can restrain the President by withholding funding. \n\nThe President literally can’t buy a light bulb for a lamp in the Oval Office without a Congressional appropriation. If the President proposes to add a new federal agency or to launch a war, Congress can bring his plans to a halt simply by refusing to fund them.  \n\nThe Constitution strikes a similar balance in foreign affairs. The President, as Commander-in-Chief, controls the strategy, tactics, and deployments of the U.S. Armed Forces, and also dictates U.S. foreign policy. Only Congress, however, has the power to declare war, and the Senate, by a two-thirds majority, must consent to any treaty negotiated by the President.\n\nCongress also has the power to impeach the President in cases of serious misconduct—treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. But the bar for impeachment is set very high to protect the President’s independence from Congress.\n\nFor the full script, visit: https://www.prageru.com/video/the-constitution-presidential-powers","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/ThKD3Py1HvA/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"3304","thumbCount":"781"},{"id":"OmMj5A0rquo","channelId":"UCdC0An4ZPNr_YiFiYoVbwaw","channelName":"Daily Dose Of Internet","title":"Halloween Decorations are Fighting Back","published":"2022-10-17T19:59:29+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T19:59:29+00:00","authorName":"Daily Dose Of Internet","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdC0An4ZPNr_YiFiYoVbwaw","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmMj5A0rquo","description":"Hello everyone, this is YOUR Daily Dose of Internet.

Peterson, Jonathan Pageau, and Mohammed Hijab discuss comparative religion, what is said about Islam versus what Islam has to say, and how the uncomfortable conversation - whether contentious or unnerving, is well worth having. \n \nMohammed Hijab is an author, comparative religionist, and philosopher of scripture. He is the co-founder of the Sapience Institute and is a researcher and instructor for the organization. He has a BA in Politics and a master’s degree in History. He has also acquired a second master’s in Islamic Studies from the School of Oriental and African Studies, as well as a third master’s degree in Applied Theology from the University of Oxford. Currently, he is working toward his PhD in Philosophy of Religion. Having completed Islamic seminary courses, he is one of very few Muslims who has been given formal permission to relay Islamic knowledge on selected Islamic fields, dealing with comparative, political, and theological issues. In his efforts, he has amassed a substantial following on YouTube, aided in part by authoring books such as “The Scientific Deception of the New Atheists.”\n \nJonathan Pageau is a French-Canadian liturgical artist and icon carver, known for his work featured in museums across the world. He carves Eastern Orthodox and other traditional images and teaches an online carving class. He also runs a YouTube channel dedicated to the exploration of symbolism across history and religion.\n \n________________________________________________________________________\n\n—Links— \n\nFor

When the government shut him down for refusing to discriminate against his unvaccinated customers, the D.C. government shut him down and took all that away. After a nine-month legal battle, Eric has been allowed to reopen, but he’s continue to push the courts to acknowledge that what the city did was illegal so that it will that much harder for future administrations to deprive Americans of their basic rights of association, assembly, speech, and due process in the future.\n\nWatch Kibbe on Liberty on BlazeTV: https://blazetv.com/kibbe\nFollow Kibbe on Liberty on Facebook: https://facebook.com/KibbeBlazeTV\nFollow Free the People on YouTube: https://youtube.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Twitter: https://twitter.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Instagram: https://instagram.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Facebook: https://facebook.com/freethepeople\nVisit Free the People's Website: https://freethepeople.org\n\nKibbe on Liberty is a weekly podcast with libertarian author, economist, and community organizer Matt Kibbe. As the president of Free the People, Kibbe has decades of experience in the libertarian political sphere, but in these troubled times he believes that open dialogue is needed to bring people together. This means being willing to talk, and especially listen, to those with whom we might not always agree, trying to understand perspectives that might otherwise be foreign to us.\n\nKibbe on Liberty's growing roster of guests includes politicians, economists, comedians, writers, radio personalities, activists, journalists, and even a magician or two—with topics of conversation ranging from current affairs to craft beer and the Grateful Dead. So grab a cold one, and settle in for the next hour of Kibbe on Liberty, mostly honest conversations with mostly interesting people.","thumbnail":"https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/6CfoR0GDsRc/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"56","thumbCount":"8"},{"id":"9L36DuQb3LY","channelId":"UCyKgD0DLtBN21gfThSalyUQ","channelName":"Melissa Dougherty","title":"If Modern Vegans Acted Like Progressive Christians.","published":"2022-10-17T13:40:31+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T13:40:33+00:00","authorName":"Melissa Dougherty","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyKgD0DLtBN21gfThSalyUQ","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L36DuQb3LY","description":"It's impossible to be certain what vegans actually believe.

It has traditionally been a place where socialist left heavyweights could thrive, and burgeoning trade unions could flourish. \n\nSince the panic-stricken derailing of the Corbyn project and the mass expulsions and rule changes that brought with it, there is no longer any chance of a functioning left in the Labour party. \n\nThere’s no chance of even a nominal pushback of the prevailing state orthodoxy and nor will there ever be, again! Those still hoping any meaningful ground can be gained or that Starmer will be replaced by another Corbyn, are fooling themselves. \n\nOn the other hand, there are those who cling to the Labour ‘brand’, because it can still get them elected. We aim to change that! Anyone serious about challenging neoliberal state imperialism needs to bid a fond farewell to the lost Labour Party, brush themselves off, and come out fighting!","thumbnail":"https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/_JDZMeSxpA8/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"628","thumbCount":"94"},{"id":"OvMBRF43C7Y","channelId":"UCf_HItERkRB3vnkWt2RSOLg","channelName":"George Galloway","title":"FULL INTERVIEW:There’s not much that’s democratic or equitable about the #UN","published":"2022-10-17T16:00:20+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T16:00:20+00:00","authorName":"George Galloway","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf_HItERkRB3vnkWt2RSOLg","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvMBRF43C7Y","description":"\"FULL INTERVIEW: #Nato is not a defence alliance.

If you haven't seen Seasons 1 & 2, search \"The Chosen\" wherever you get your apps and on your streaming devices.\n \n“Come to me, you who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.” That's the theme of Season 3, and man, that applied to those of us making the show as well. It's taken a long time for Season 3 to get here, and believe me, it wasn't by choice. From supply chain issues affecting our construction, to Covid delays, to weather, the making of Season 3 for sure made us weary and heavy-laden. We don't get to escape the themes of each season.\n \nBut as you'll see from this trailer, I believe it was worth it. We launch Season Three in theaters, with Episodes 1 & 2 coming to most English-speaking countries on November 18 for a limited run on the big screen. And don't worry, if you can't see it in theaters, you'll soon after get it free and easy on streaming. So what are you going to see?\n \nSeason Three picks up where Season Two left off (you should watch that season if you haven't-—I promise Season Three will make more sense), with Jesus delivering the most famous sermon in history. What follows are the consequences of living out his teachings. The world changes because of this sermon, and the believers in (and enemies of) Jesus increase exponentially. This creates confusion, chaos, and yes, doubt, and we don't gloss over any of that in this season. I assure you, you're going to see some tough questions asked that you've no doubt experienced yourself. But...\n \nHe gives rest.\n \nThank you for your patience with this season. The good news is, while you've been waiting, literally tens of millions of people around the world have discovered The Chosen, and we are optimistic Season 3 will enlarge this movement even more. Be sure to watch this entire trailer for all the info you'll need to experience Season 3.

In this interview on Conversations That Matter with The New American magazine's Alex Newman, Rubacek describes her interviews with numerous sources in China--both victims and perpetrators--and how she stumbled upon the term \"Walking Dead\" used to describe the individuals who perpetrate these ghastly atrocities against their fellow human beings. Her new book examines how human beings could inflict such evil on others. Her new movie, meanwhile, focuses on providing hope. Rubacek hopes America will learn from the horrors of Communist China, as she warns that the United States could--in a worst-case scenario--end up like China. \n\n🇺🇸 The New

A woman apparently told responding officers that her son, 29-year-old Tyler Patrick, was acting delusional and banging on the house. Officers spoke with Patrick inside the residence and determined that he should be taken to a local hospital. As one officer, later identified as Off. George Kloos, tried to walk Patrick out of the residence, he swung a concealed [pocket] knife at the officer and stabbed Kloos in the neck. \n\nPatrick then attempted to stab two other officers as they tackled him onto a couch. Officers “wrestled” the knife out of his hand and took him into custody. Patrick was taken to the hospital for minor injuries he suffered during his arrest. He was treated, released and booked in the Montgomery County Jail. Patrick is facing three counts of felonious assault of a peace officer. Patrick appeared in court Friday afternoon where his bond was set at $500,000. He’s set to appear in court next on October 24, 2022. Officer Kloos, 10-year veteran of the force, was taken to Miami Valley Hospital and was released later that day. Doctors said the knife somehow missed the arteries in his neck. He is now home, and expected to make a full recovery.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nSpecial thanks to Shout-Out Supporters on Patreon:\n- Charles Cooper\n- Joe\n- Cooper Malley\n- Luis Perez\n- Chris Wesley\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity","thumbnail":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/UZ-jkQs3EvQ/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"268871","thumbCount":"8870"},{"id":"f6263LFJfuc","channelId":"UCc-0YpRpqgA5lPTpSQ5uo-Q","channelName":"Audit the Audit","title":"When Not Showing Your Receipt Goes HORRIBLY Wrong","published":"2022-10-17T13:00:22+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T13:00:22+00:00","authorName":"Audit the Audit","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-0YpRpqgA5lPTpSQ5uo-Q","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6263LFJfuc","description":"Second Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClTjur-9cx8Bb4MW8r0K6xw\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/audittheaudit\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AuditTheAudit\n\nSubmit your videos here: auditheaudit@gmail.com\n\nSponsorship inquiries: audit@ellify.com\n\nWelcome to Audit the Audit, where we sort out the who and what and the right and wrong of police interactions.

This is before as well, the technician, unfortunately, didn't have a clip of it afterward. \n0:23 Close to 110 psi / 7.5 bar in this tire that should only have around 3-35 psi. The tire light will still be on if the tires are overfilled.\n0:31 The technician said: \"All she told us is that she ran off the road and it wasn't at a bad angle so she didn't know why the airbags went off. We said that she had to have it so close to rolling over, the SDM thought it was rolling and deployed the airbags. Hard to get the full story out of a lot of these customers.\"\n0:46 The lower control arm was damaged (bent), the strut was completely broken and the tire had sidewall damage. The technician was driving it out of the after he quoted the repairs. \n1:02 The technician said this somehow drove in as well. The idler arm wasn't bolted to the center link, missing cotter pins and the toe was off due to the tie rod ends not being installed correctly.\n1:26 Bushings that needed to be replaced were for the lateral arms and transmission mount. The customer finally got them replaced as their \"fix\" didn't fix the clunking noise. The first time the customer declined repairs as they said they didn't like the quote. \n1:37 The technician said he has never seen this before and doesn't know what caused this as there seems to be no impact damage. As well these are the original steel wheels (OEM). \n1:53 The battery is too big so the battery posts touch the underneath of the hood which causes the sparks.\n2:00 A Toyota badge, Subaru wheel caps, and Scion steering wheel. \nThe technician it was actually a Scion FR-S\n2:13 The technician said: \"I don't know I never got the full story. The crazy thing is that truck was driven in like that. I quoted a new lower control arm, rotor, hub(it was obviously bent but you can't see that in the video but when you rotate the hub you can see the run out with just your eye), c/v boots (the outer boot was torn and slinging grease), brake line, and front strut assembly.  I also told the service writer there may be other parts messed up (steering knuckle or possibly upper control arm as well) and that I wouldn't be able to tell until I got the rest of it fixed and on the alignment machine.\"\n2:24 Surprising to see this in a company vehicle. The technician thinks it's wired like this so the person who drives this company vehicle can quickly/easily remove it if needed. What a terrible wiring job though!\n3:01 Not sure if the deer (doe) was okay or not since it ran away.\nThe viewer who shared this said it's something you would never believe if you didn't see it on camera. He said if he has time/remembers, he will give us an update. \n3:15 Outro.

They didn’t want to install a new one of their own making. So how did the Framers ensure that the President would have enough power to be an effective chief executive, without making him a dictator? John Yoo, Professor of Law at the University of California, Berkeley, has the answer.\n\n#prageru #president #constitution #history #americanhistory \n\nSUBSCRIBE 👉 https://www.prageru.com/join\n\nScript:\n\nHow much power should we give to the President? This was one of the most vexing (and critical) questions facing the Framers of the United States Constitution in the summer of 1787. \n\nTo be effective, the President had to be perceived—both in times of war and peace—as the leader of the nation. For this to happen, he would have to be given significant authority. Americans learned this lesson in the years following the Revolutionary War when the nation floundered under the Articles of Confederation which had no provision for a chief executive.\n\nBut this chief executive couldn’t be made so strong that he could become a tyrant. Americans fought a long and bloody war to get rid of one tyrant, the English King, George III. Nobody wanted to install a new one in his place. \n\nThe Framers answer is found in Article II.\n\nThe opening sentence reads as follows: “[t]he executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States.” This might sound straightforward, but it was anything but. \n\nHere’s why.\n\n“The vesting clause” of Article II, as it’s known, differs significantly from the vesting clause of Article I, which concerns the powers of Congress—the House of Representatives and the Senate. Article I’s vesting clause states: “all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States…” It then goes on to list those limited powers. That’s it. Congress can’t do anything else. \n\nThere are no such limitations specified in Article II. The difference is subtle, but important. \n\nWhereas Congress is given specific responsibilities, the President is given broad responsibilities and wide discretion as to how he fulfills them. This is part of his executive authority.\n\nAnd just what is that executive authority?\n\nThis is spelled out in Sections 2 and 3. \n\nThe President is the commander in chief of the armed services. He sets military policy. \n\nHe makes treaties with foreign countries. He sets foreign policy.\n\nHe appoints his own advisors—what became known as his cabinet. He sets domestic policy. \n\nHe appoints judges to the Supreme Court. That obviously gives him a big say in judicial policy.\n\nAnd finally, “he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” \n\nThis list is at once brief and vast because there’s so much involved in all these duties. Indeed, the President stands at the head of the entire administrative apparatus of the Federal government with all the rights and responsibilities that entails. For example, if the President can appoint federal officials, it stands to reason that he must be able to fire them, too. \n\nWhen you realize that enforcing the law involves layers and layers of people from department heads to federal law enforcement to government lawyers, all of whom are accountable to the President, you start to grasp how much power the chief executive has. \n\nSo, how did the Framers keep the President in check? \n\nFirst and foremost, they gave Congress “the power of the purse,” the power to fund the operations of the federal government. Congress can restrain the President by withholding funding. \n\nThe President literally can’t buy a light bulb for a lamp in the Oval Office without a Congressional appropriation. If the President proposes to add a new federal agency or to launch a war, Congress can bring his plans to a halt simply by refusing to fund them.  \n\nThe Constitution strikes a similar balance in foreign affairs. The President, as Commander-in-Chief, controls the strategy, tactics, and deployments of the U.S. Armed Forces, and also dictates U.S. foreign policy. Only Congress, however, has the power to declare war, and the Senate, by a two-thirds majority, must consent to any treaty negotiated by the President.\n\nCongress also has the power to impeach the President in cases of serious misconduct—treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. But the bar for impeachment is set very high to protect the President’s independence from Congress.\n\nFor the full script, visit: https://www.prageru.com/video/the-constitution-presidential-powers","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/ThKD3Py1HvA/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"3304","thumbCount":"781"},{"id":"OmMj5A0rquo","channelId":"UCdC0An4ZPNr_YiFiYoVbwaw","channelName":"Daily Dose Of Internet","title":"Halloween Decorations are Fighting Back","published":"2022-10-17T19:59:29+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T19:59:29+00:00","authorName":"Daily Dose Of Internet","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdC0An4ZPNr_YiFiYoVbwaw","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmMj5A0rquo","description":"Hello everyone, this is YOUR Daily Dose of Internet.

Peterson, Jonathan Pageau, and Mohammed Hijab discuss comparative religion, what is said about Islam versus what Islam has to say, and how the uncomfortable conversation - whether contentious or unnerving, is well worth having. \n \nMohammed Hijab is an author, comparative religionist, and philosopher of scripture. He is the co-founder of the Sapience Institute and is a researcher and instructor for the organization. He has a BA in Politics and a master’s degree in History. He has also acquired a second master’s in Islamic Studies from the School of Oriental and African Studies, as well as a third master’s degree in Applied Theology from the University of Oxford. Currently, he is working toward his PhD in Philosophy of Religion. Having completed Islamic seminary courses, he is one of very few Muslims who has been given formal permission to relay Islamic knowledge on selected Islamic fields, dealing with comparative, political, and theological issues. In his efforts, he has amassed a substantial following on YouTube, aided in part by authoring books such as “The Scientific Deception of the New Atheists.”\n \nJonathan Pageau is a French-Canadian liturgical artist and icon carver, known for his work featured in museums across the world. He carves Eastern Orthodox and other traditional images and teaches an online carving class. He also runs a YouTube channel dedicated to the exploration of symbolism across history and religion.\n \n________________________________________________________________________\n\n—Links— \n\nFor

When the government shut him down for refusing to discriminate against his unvaccinated customers, the D.C. government shut him down and took all that away. After a nine-month legal battle, Eric has been allowed to reopen, but he’s continue to push the courts to acknowledge that what the city did was illegal so that it will that much harder for future administrations to deprive Americans of their basic rights of association, assembly, speech, and due process in the future.\n\nWatch Kibbe on Liberty on BlazeTV: https://blazetv.com/kibbe\nFollow Kibbe on Liberty on Facebook: https://facebook.com/KibbeBlazeTV\nFollow Free the People on YouTube: https://youtube.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Twitter: https://twitter.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Instagram: https://instagram.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Facebook: https://facebook.com/freethepeople\nVisit Free the People's Website: https://freethepeople.org\n\nKibbe on Liberty is a weekly podcast with libertarian author, economist, and community organizer Matt Kibbe. As the president of Free the People, Kibbe has decades of experience in the libertarian political sphere, but in these troubled times he believes that open dialogue is needed to bring people together. This means being willing to talk, and especially listen, to those with whom we might not always agree, trying to understand perspectives that might otherwise be foreign to us.\n\nKibbe on Liberty's growing roster of guests includes politicians, economists, comedians, writers, radio personalities, activists, journalists, and even a magician or two—with topics of conversation ranging from current affairs to craft beer and the Grateful Dead. So grab a cold one, and settle in for the next hour of Kibbe on Liberty, mostly honest conversations with mostly interesting people.","thumbnail":"https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/6CfoR0GDsRc/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"56","thumbCount":"8"},{"id":"9L36DuQb3LY","channelId":"UCyKgD0DLtBN21gfThSalyUQ","channelName":"Melissa Dougherty","title":"If Modern Vegans Acted Like Progressive Christians.","published":"2022-10-17T13:40:31+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T13:40:33+00:00","authorName":"Melissa Dougherty","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyKgD0DLtBN21gfThSalyUQ","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L36DuQb3LY","description":"It's impossible to be certain what vegans actually believe.

It has traditionally been a place where socialist left heavyweights could thrive, and burgeoning trade unions could flourish. \n\nSince the panic-stricken derailing of the Corbyn project and the mass expulsions and rule changes that brought with it, there is no longer any chance of a functioning left in the Labour party. \n\nThere’s no chance of even a nominal pushback of the prevailing state orthodoxy and nor will there ever be, again! Those still hoping any meaningful ground can be gained or that Starmer will be replaced by another Corbyn, are fooling themselves. \n\nOn the other hand, there are those who cling to the Labour ‘brand’, because it can still get them elected. We aim to change that! Anyone serious about challenging neoliberal state imperialism needs to bid a fond farewell to the lost Labour Party, brush themselves off, and come out fighting!","thumbnail":"https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/_JDZMeSxpA8/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"628","thumbCount":"94"},{"id":"OvMBRF43C7Y","channelId":"UCf_HItERkRB3vnkWt2RSOLg","channelName":"George Galloway","title":"FULL INTERVIEW:There’s not much that’s democratic or equitable about the #UN","published":"2022-10-17T16:00:20+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T16:00:20+00:00","authorName":"George Galloway","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf_HItERkRB3vnkWt2RSOLg","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvMBRF43C7Y","description":"\"FULL INTERVIEW: #Nato is not a defence alliance.

If you haven't seen Seasons 1 & 2, search \"The Chosen\" wherever you get your apps and on your streaming devices.\n \n“Come to me, you who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.” That's the theme of Season 3, and man, that applied to those of us making the show as well. It's taken a long time for Season 3 to get here, and believe me, it wasn't by choice. From supply chain issues affecting our construction, to Covid delays, to weather, the making of Season 3 for sure made us weary and heavy-laden. We don't get to escape the themes of each season.\n \nBut as you'll see from this trailer, I believe it was worth it. We launch Season Three in theaters, with Episodes 1 & 2 coming to most English-speaking countries on November 18 for a limited run on the big screen. And don't worry, if you can't see it in theaters, you'll soon after get it free and easy on streaming. So what are you going to see?\n \nSeason Three picks up where Season Two left off (you should watch that season if you haven't-—I promise Season Three will make more sense), with Jesus delivering the most famous sermon in history. What follows are the consequences of living out his teachings. The world changes because of this sermon, and the believers in (and enemies of) Jesus increase exponentially. This creates confusion, chaos, and yes, doubt, and we don't gloss over any of that in this season. I assure you, you're going to see some tough questions asked that you've no doubt experienced yourself. But...\n \nHe gives rest.\n \nThank you for your patience with this season. The good news is, while you've been waiting, literally tens of millions of people around the world have discovered The Chosen, and we are optimistic Season 3 will enlarge this movement even more. Be sure to watch this entire trailer for all the info you'll need to experience Season 3.

In this interview on Conversations That Matter with The New American magazine's Alex Newman, Rubacek describes her interviews with numerous sources in China--both victims and perpetrators--and how she stumbled upon the term \"Walking Dead\" used to describe the individuals who perpetrate these ghastly atrocities against their fellow human beings. Her new book examines how human beings could inflict such evil on others. Her new movie, meanwhile, focuses on providing hope. Rubacek hopes America will learn from the horrors of Communist China, as she warns that the United States could--in a worst-case scenario--end up like China. \n\n🇺🇸 The New

A woman apparently told responding officers that her son, 29-year-old Tyler Patrick, was acting delusional and banging on the house. Officers spoke with Patrick inside the residence and determined that he should be taken to a local hospital. As one officer, later identified as Off. George Kloos, tried to walk Patrick out of the residence, he swung a concealed [pocket] knife at the officer and stabbed Kloos in the neck. \n\nPatrick then attempted to stab two other officers as they tackled him onto a couch. Officers “wrestled” the knife out of his hand and took him into custody. Patrick was taken to the hospital for minor injuries he suffered during his arrest. He was treated, released and booked in the Montgomery County Jail. Patrick is facing three counts of felonious assault of a peace officer. Patrick appeared in court Friday afternoon where his bond was set at $500,000. He’s set to appear in court next on October 24, 2022. Officer Kloos, 10-year veteran of the force, was taken to Miami Valley Hospital and was released later that day. Doctors said the knife somehow missed the arteries in his neck. He is now home, and expected to make a full recovery.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nSpecial thanks to Shout-Out Supporters on Patreon:\n- Charles Cooper\n- Joe\n- Cooper Malley\n- Luis Perez\n- Chris Wesley\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity","thumbnail":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/UZ-jkQs3EvQ/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"268871","thumbCount":"8870"},{"id":"f6263LFJfuc","channelId":"UCc-0YpRpqgA5lPTpSQ5uo-Q","channelName":"Audit the Audit","title":"When Not Showing Your Receipt Goes HORRIBLY Wrong","published":"2022-10-17T13:00:22+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T13:00:22+00:00","authorName":"Audit the Audit","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-0YpRpqgA5lPTpSQ5uo-Q","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6263LFJfuc","description":"Second Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClTjur-9cx8Bb4MW8r0K6xw\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/audittheaudit\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AuditTheAudit\n\nSubmit your videos here: auditheaudit@gmail.com\n\nSponsorship inquiries: audit@ellify.com\n\nWelcome to Audit the Audit, where we sort out the who and what and the right and wrong of police interactions.

This is before as well, the technician, unfortunately, didn't have a clip of it afterward. \n0:23 Close to 110 psi / 7.5 bar in this tire that should only have around 3-35 psi. The tire light will still be on if the tires are overfilled.\n0:31 The technician said: \"All she told us is that she ran off the road and it wasn't at a bad angle so she didn't know why the airbags went off. We said that she had to have it so close to rolling over, the SDM thought it was rolling and deployed the airbags. Hard to get the full story out of a lot of these customers.\"\n0:46 The lower control arm was damaged (bent), the strut was completely broken and the tire had sidewall damage. The technician was driving it out of the after he quoted the repairs. \n1:02 The technician said this somehow drove in as well. The idler arm wasn't bolted to the center link, missing cotter pins and the toe was off due to the tie rod ends not being installed correctly.\n1:26 Bushings that needed to be replaced were for the lateral arms and transmission mount. The customer finally got them replaced as their \"fix\" didn't fix the clunking noise. The first time the customer declined repairs as they said they didn't like the quote. \n1:37 The technician said he has never seen this before and doesn't know what caused this as there seems to be no impact damage. As well these are the original steel wheels (OEM). \n1:53 The battery is too big so the battery posts touch the underneath of the hood which causes the sparks.\n2:00 A Toyota badge, Subaru wheel caps, and Scion steering wheel. \nThe technician it was actually a Scion FR-S\n2:13 The technician said: \"I don't know I never got the full story. The crazy thing is that truck was driven in like that. I quoted a new lower control arm, rotor, hub(it was obviously bent but you can't see that in the video but when you rotate the hub you can see the run out with just your eye), c/v boots (the outer boot was torn and slinging grease), brake line, and front strut assembly.  I also told the service writer there may be other parts messed up (steering knuckle or possibly upper control arm as well) and that I wouldn't be able to tell until I got the rest of it fixed and on the alignment machine.\"\n2:24 Surprising to see this in a company vehicle. The technician thinks it's wired like this so the person who drives this company vehicle can quickly/easily remove it if needed. What a terrible wiring job though!\n3:01 Not sure if the deer (doe) was okay or not since it ran away.\nThe viewer who shared this said it's something you would never believe if you didn't see it on camera. He said if he has time/remembers, he will give us an update. \n3:15 Outro.

They didn’t want to install a new one of their own making. So how did the Framers ensure that the President would have enough power to be an effective chief executive, without making him a dictator? John Yoo, Professor of Law at the University of California, Berkeley, has the answer.\n\n#prageru #president #constitution #history #americanhistory \n\nSUBSCRIBE 👉 https://www.prageru.com/join\n\nScript:\n\nHow much power should we give to the President? This was one of the most vexing (and critical) questions facing the Framers of the United States Constitution in the summer of 1787. \n\nTo be effective, the President had to be perceived—both in times of war and peace—as the leader of the nation. For this to happen, he would have to be given significant authority. Americans learned this lesson in the years following the Revolutionary War when the nation floundered under the Articles of Confederation which had no provision for a chief executive.\n\nBut this chief executive couldn’t be made so strong that he could become a tyrant. Americans fought a long and bloody war to get rid of one tyrant, the English King, George III. Nobody wanted to install a new one in his place. \n\nThe Framers answer is found in Article II.\n\nThe opening sentence reads as follows: “[t]he executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States.” This might sound straightforward, but it was anything but. \n\nHere’s why.\n\n“The vesting clause” of Article II, as it’s known, differs significantly from the vesting clause of Article I, which concerns the powers of Congress—the House of Representatives and the Senate. Article I’s vesting clause states: “all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States…” It then goes on to list those limited powers. That’s it. Congress can’t do anything else. \n\nThere are no such limitations specified in Article II. The difference is subtle, but important. \n\nWhereas Congress is given specific responsibilities, the President is given broad responsibilities and wide discretion as to how he fulfills them. This is part of his executive authority.\n\nAnd just what is that executive authority?\n\nThis is spelled out in Sections 2 and 3. \n\nThe President is the commander in chief of the armed services. He sets military policy. \n\nHe makes treaties with foreign countries. He sets foreign policy.\n\nHe appoints his own advisors—what became known as his cabinet. He sets domestic policy. \n\nHe appoints judges to the Supreme Court. That obviously gives him a big say in judicial policy.\n\nAnd finally, “he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” \n\nThis list is at once brief and vast because there’s so much involved in all these duties. Indeed, the President stands at the head of the entire administrative apparatus of the Federal government with all the rights and responsibilities that entails. For example, if the President can appoint federal officials, it stands to reason that he must be able to fire them, too. \n\nWhen you realize that enforcing the law involves layers and layers of people from department heads to federal law enforcement to government lawyers, all of whom are accountable to the President, you start to grasp how much power the chief executive has. \n\nSo, how did the Framers keep the President in check? \n\nFirst and foremost, they gave Congress “the power of the purse,” the power to fund the operations of the federal government. Congress can restrain the President by withholding funding. \n\nThe President literally can’t buy a light bulb for a lamp in the Oval Office without a Congressional appropriation. If the President proposes to add a new federal agency or to launch a war, Congress can bring his plans to a halt simply by refusing to fund them.  \n\nThe Constitution strikes a similar balance in foreign affairs. The President, as Commander-in-Chief, controls the strategy, tactics, and deployments of the U.S. Armed Forces, and also dictates U.S. foreign policy. Only Congress, however, has the power to declare war, and the Senate, by a two-thirds majority, must consent to any treaty negotiated by the President.\n\nCongress also has the power to impeach the President in cases of serious misconduct—treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. But the bar for impeachment is set very high to protect the President’s independence from Congress.\n\nFor the full script, visit: https://www.prageru.com/video/the-constitution-presidential-powers","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/ThKD3Py1HvA/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"3304","thumbCount":"781"},{"id":"OmMj5A0rquo","channelId":"UCdC0An4ZPNr_YiFiYoVbwaw","channelName":"Daily Dose Of Internet","title":"Halloween Decorations are Fighting Back","published":"2022-10-17T19:59:29+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T19:59:29+00:00","authorName":"Daily Dose Of Internet","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdC0An4ZPNr_YiFiYoVbwaw","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmMj5A0rquo","description":"Hello everyone, this is YOUR Daily Dose of Internet.

Peterson, Jonathan Pageau, and Mohammed Hijab discuss comparative religion, what is said about Islam versus what Islam has to say, and how the uncomfortable conversation - whether contentious or unnerving, is well worth having. \n \nMohammed Hijab is an author, comparative religionist, and philosopher of scripture. He is the co-founder of the Sapience Institute and is a researcher and instructor for the organization. He has a BA in Politics and a master’s degree in History. He has also acquired a second master’s in Islamic Studies from the School of Oriental and African Studies, as well as a third master’s degree in Applied Theology from the University of Oxford. Currently, he is working toward his PhD in Philosophy of Religion. Having completed Islamic seminary courses, he is one of very few Muslims who has been given formal permission to relay Islamic knowledge on selected Islamic fields, dealing with comparative, political, and theological issues. In his efforts, he has amassed a substantial following on YouTube, aided in part by authoring books such as “The Scientific Deception of the New Atheists.”\n \nJonathan Pageau is a French-Canadian liturgical artist and icon carver, known for his work featured in museums across the world. He carves Eastern Orthodox and other traditional images and teaches an online carving class. He also runs a YouTube channel dedicated to the exploration of symbolism across history and religion.\n \n________________________________________________________________________\n\n—Links— \n\nFor

When the government shut him down for refusing to discriminate against his unvaccinated customers, the D.C. government shut him down and took all that away. After a nine-month legal battle, Eric has been allowed to reopen, but he’s continue to push the courts to acknowledge that what the city did was illegal so that it will that much harder for future administrations to deprive Americans of their basic rights of association, assembly, speech, and due process in the future.\n\nWatch Kibbe on Liberty on BlazeTV: https://blazetv.com/kibbe\nFollow Kibbe on Liberty on Facebook: https://facebook.com/KibbeBlazeTV\nFollow Free the People on YouTube: https://youtube.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Twitter: https://twitter.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Instagram: https://instagram.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Facebook: https://facebook.com/freethepeople\nVisit Free the People's Website: https://freethepeople.org\n\nKibbe on Liberty is a weekly podcast with libertarian author, economist, and community organizer Matt Kibbe. As the president of Free the People, Kibbe has decades of experience in the libertarian political sphere, but in these troubled times he believes that open dialogue is needed to bring people together. This means being willing to talk, and especially listen, to those with whom we might not always agree, trying to understand perspectives that might otherwise be foreign to us.\n\nKibbe on Liberty's growing roster of guests includes politicians, economists, comedians, writers, radio personalities, activists, journalists, and even a magician or two—with topics of conversation ranging from current affairs to craft beer and the Grateful Dead. So grab a cold one, and settle in for the next hour of Kibbe on Liberty, mostly honest conversations with mostly interesting people.","thumbnail":"https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/6CfoR0GDsRc/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"56","thumbCount":"8"},{"id":"9L36DuQb3LY","channelId":"UCyKgD0DLtBN21gfThSalyUQ","channelName":"Melissa Dougherty","title":"If Modern Vegans Acted Like Progressive Christians.","published":"2022-10-17T13:40:31+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T13:40:33+00:00","authorName":"Melissa Dougherty","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyKgD0DLtBN21gfThSalyUQ","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L36DuQb3LY","description":"It's impossible to be certain what vegans actually believe.

It has traditionally been a place where socialist left heavyweights could thrive, and burgeoning trade unions could flourish. \n\nSince the panic-stricken derailing of the Corbyn project and the mass expulsions and rule changes that brought with it, there is no longer any chance of a functioning left in the Labour party. \n\nThere’s no chance of even a nominal pushback of the prevailing state orthodoxy and nor will there ever be, again! Those still hoping any meaningful ground can be gained or that Starmer will be replaced by another Corbyn, are fooling themselves. \n\nOn the other hand, there are those who cling to the Labour ‘brand’, because it can still get them elected. We aim to change that! Anyone serious about challenging neoliberal state imperialism needs to bid a fond farewell to the lost Labour Party, brush themselves off, and come out fighting!","thumbnail":"https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/_JDZMeSxpA8/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"628","thumbCount":"94"},{"id":"OvMBRF43C7Y","channelId":"UCf_HItERkRB3vnkWt2RSOLg","channelName":"George Galloway","title":"FULL INTERVIEW:There’s not much that’s democratic or equitable about the #UN","published":"2022-10-17T16:00:20+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T16:00:20+00:00","authorName":"George Galloway","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf_HItERkRB3vnkWt2RSOLg","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvMBRF43C7Y","description":"\"FULL INTERVIEW: #Nato is not a defence alliance.

If you haven't seen Seasons 1 & 2, search \"The Chosen\" wherever you get your apps and on your streaming devices.\n \n“Come to me, you who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.” That's the theme of Season 3, and man, that applied to those of us making the show as well. It's taken a long time for Season 3 to get here, and believe me, it wasn't by choice. From supply chain issues affecting our construction, to Covid delays, to weather, the making of Season 3 for sure made us weary and heavy-laden. We don't get to escape the themes of each season.\n \nBut as you'll see from this trailer, I believe it was worth it. We launch Season Three in theaters, with Episodes 1 & 2 coming to most English-speaking countries on November 18 for a limited run on the big screen. And don't worry, if you can't see it in theaters, you'll soon after get it free and easy on streaming. So what are you going to see?\n \nSeason Three picks up where Season Two left off (you should watch that season if you haven't-—I promise Season Three will make more sense), with Jesus delivering the most famous sermon in history. What follows are the consequences of living out his teachings. The world changes because of this sermon, and the believers in (and enemies of) Jesus increase exponentially. This creates confusion, chaos, and yes, doubt, and we don't gloss over any of that in this season. I assure you, you're going to see some tough questions asked that you've no doubt experienced yourself. But...\n \nHe gives rest.\n \nThank you for your patience with this season. The good news is, while you've been waiting, literally tens of millions of people around the world have discovered The Chosen, and we are optimistic Season 3 will enlarge this movement even more. Be sure to watch this entire trailer for all the info you'll need to experience Season 3.

In this interview on Conversations That Matter with The New American magazine's Alex Newman, Rubacek describes her interviews with numerous sources in China--both victims and perpetrators--and how she stumbled upon the term \"Walking Dead\" used to describe the individuals who perpetrate these ghastly atrocities against their fellow human beings. Her new book examines how human beings could inflict such evil on others. Her new movie, meanwhile, focuses on providing hope. Rubacek hopes America will learn from the horrors of Communist China, as she warns that the United States could--in a worst-case scenario--end up like China. \n\n🇺🇸 The New

A woman apparently told responding officers that her son, 29-year-old Tyler Patrick, was acting delusional and banging on the house. Officers spoke with Patrick inside the residence and determined that he should be taken to a local hospital. As one officer, later identified as Off. George Kloos, tried to walk Patrick out of the residence, he swung a concealed [pocket] knife at the officer and stabbed Kloos in the neck. \n\nPatrick then attempted to stab two other officers as they tackled him onto a couch. Officers “wrestled” the knife out of his hand and took him into custody. Patrick was taken to the hospital for minor injuries he suffered during his arrest. He was treated, released and booked in the Montgomery County Jail. Patrick is facing three counts of felonious assault of a peace officer. Patrick appeared in court Friday afternoon where his bond was set at $500,000. He’s set to appear in court next on October 24, 2022. Officer Kloos, 10-year veteran of the force, was taken to Miami Valley Hospital and was released later that day. Doctors said the knife somehow missed the arteries in his neck. He is now home, and expected to make a full recovery.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nSpecial thanks to Shout-Out Supporters on Patreon:\n- Charles Cooper\n- Joe\n- Cooper Malley\n- Luis Perez\n- Chris Wesley\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity","thumbnail":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/UZ-jkQs3EvQ/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"268871","thumbCount":"8870"},{"id":"f6263LFJfuc","channelId":"UCc-0YpRpqgA5lPTpSQ5uo-Q","channelName":"Audit the Audit","title":"When Not Showing Your Receipt Goes HORRIBLY Wrong","published":"2022-10-17T13:00:22+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T13:00:22+00:00","authorName":"Audit the Audit","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-0YpRpqgA5lPTpSQ5uo-Q","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6263LFJfuc","description":"Second Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClTjur-9cx8Bb4MW8r0K6xw\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/audittheaudit\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AuditTheAudit\n\nSubmit your videos here: auditheaudit@gmail.com\n\nSponsorship inquiries: audit@ellify.com\n\nWelcome to Audit the Audit, where we sort out the who and what and the right and wrong of police interactions.

This is before as well, the technician, unfortunately, didn't have a clip of it afterward. \n0:23 Close to 110 psi / 7.5 bar in this tire that should only have around 3-35 psi. The tire light will still be on if the tires are overfilled.\n0:31 The technician said: \"All she told us is that she ran off the road and it wasn't at a bad angle so she didn't know why the airbags went off. We said that she had to have it so close to rolling over, the SDM thought it was rolling and deployed the airbags. Hard to get the full story out of a lot of these customers.\"\n0:46 The lower control arm was damaged (bent), the strut was completely broken and the tire had sidewall damage. The technician was driving it out of the after he quoted the repairs. \n1:02 The technician said this somehow drove in as well. The idler arm wasn't bolted to the center link, missing cotter pins and the toe was off due to the tie rod ends not being installed correctly.\n1:26 Bushings that needed to be replaced were for the lateral arms and transmission mount. The customer finally got them replaced as their \"fix\" didn't fix the clunking noise. The first time the customer declined repairs as they said they didn't like the quote. \n1:37 The technician said he has never seen this before and doesn't know what caused this as there seems to be no impact damage. As well these are the original steel wheels (OEM). \n1:53 The battery is too big so the battery posts touch the underneath of the hood which causes the sparks.\n2:00 A Toyota badge, Subaru wheel caps, and Scion steering wheel. \nThe technician it was actually a Scion FR-S\n2:13 The technician said: \"I don't know I never got the full story. The crazy thing is that truck was driven in like that. I quoted a new lower control arm, rotor, hub(it was obviously bent but you can't see that in the video but when you rotate the hub you can see the run out with just your eye), c/v boots (the outer boot was torn and slinging grease), brake line, and front strut assembly.  I also told the service writer there may be other parts messed up (steering knuckle or possibly upper control arm as well) and that I wouldn't be able to tell until I got the rest of it fixed and on the alignment machine.\"\n2:24 Surprising to see this in a company vehicle. The technician thinks it's wired like this so the person who drives this company vehicle can quickly/easily remove it if needed. What a terrible wiring job though!\n3:01 Not sure if the deer (doe) was okay or not since it ran away.\nThe viewer who shared this said it's something you would never believe if you didn't see it on camera. He said if he has time/remembers, he will give us an update. \n3:15 Outro.

They didn’t want to install a new one of their own making. So how did the Framers ensure that the President would have enough power to be an effective chief executive, without making him a dictator? John Yoo, Professor of Law at the University of California, Berkeley, has the answer.\n\n#prageru #president #constitution #history #americanhistory \n\nSUBSCRIBE 👉 https://www.prageru.com/join\n\nScript:\n\nHow much power should we give to the President? This was one of the most vexing (and critical) questions facing the Framers of the United States Constitution in the summer of 1787. \n\nTo be effective, the President had to be perceived—both in times of war and peace—as the leader of the nation. For this to happen, he would have to be given significant authority. Americans learned this lesson in the years following the Revolutionary War when the nation floundered under the Articles of Confederation which had no provision for a chief executive.\n\nBut this chief executive couldn’t be made so strong that he could become a tyrant. Americans fought a long and bloody war to get rid of one tyrant, the English King, George III. Nobody wanted to install a new one in his place. \n\nThe Framers answer is found in Article II.\n\nThe opening sentence reads as follows: “[t]he executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States.” This might sound straightforward, but it was anything but. \n\nHere’s why.\n\n“The vesting clause” of Article II, as it’s known, differs significantly from the vesting clause of Article I, which concerns the powers of Congress—the House of Representatives and the Senate. Article I’s vesting clause states: “all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States…” It then goes on to list those limited powers. That’s it. Congress can’t do anything else. \n\nThere are no such limitations specified in Article II. The difference is subtle, but important. \n\nWhereas Congress is given specific responsibilities, the President is given broad responsibilities and wide discretion as to how he fulfills them. This is part of his executive authority.\n\nAnd just what is that executive authority?\n\nThis is spelled out in Sections 2 and 3. \n\nThe President is the commander in chief of the armed services. He sets military policy. \n\nHe makes treaties with foreign countries. He sets foreign policy.\n\nHe appoints his own advisors—what became known as his cabinet. He sets domestic policy. \n\nHe appoints judges to the Supreme Court. That obviously gives him a big say in judicial policy.\n\nAnd finally, “he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” \n\nThis list is at once brief and vast because there’s so much involved in all these duties. Indeed, the President stands at the head of the entire administrative apparatus of the Federal government with all the rights and responsibilities that entails. For example, if the President can appoint federal officials, it stands to reason that he must be able to fire them, too. \n\nWhen you realize that enforcing the law involves layers and layers of people from department heads to federal law enforcement to government lawyers, all of whom are accountable to the President, you start to grasp how much power the chief executive has. \n\nSo, how did the Framers keep the President in check? \n\nFirst and foremost, they gave Congress “the power of the purse,” the power to fund the operations of the federal government. Congress can restrain the President by withholding funding. \n\nThe President literally can’t buy a light bulb for a lamp in the Oval Office without a Congressional appropriation. If the President proposes to add a new federal agency or to launch a war, Congress can bring his plans to a halt simply by refusing to fund them.  \n\nThe Constitution strikes a similar balance in foreign affairs. The President, as Commander-in-Chief, controls the strategy, tactics, and deployments of the U.S. Armed Forces, and also dictates U.S. foreign policy. Only Congress, however, has the power to declare war, and the Senate, by a two-thirds majority, must consent to any treaty negotiated by the President.\n\nCongress also has the power to impeach the President in cases of serious misconduct—treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. But the bar for impeachment is set very high to protect the President’s independence from Congress.\n\nFor the full script, visit: https://www.prageru.com/video/the-constitution-presidential-powers","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/ThKD3Py1HvA/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"3304","thumbCount":"781"},{"id":"OmMj5A0rquo","channelId":"UCdC0An4ZPNr_YiFiYoVbwaw","channelName":"Daily Dose Of Internet","title":"Halloween Decorations are Fighting Back","published":"2022-10-17T19:59:29+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T19:59:29+00:00","authorName":"Daily Dose Of Internet","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdC0An4ZPNr_YiFiYoVbwaw","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmMj5A0rquo","description":"Hello everyone, this is YOUR Daily Dose of Internet.

Peterson, Jonathan Pageau, and Mohammed Hijab discuss comparative religion, what is said about Islam versus what Islam has to say, and how the uncomfortable conversation - whether contentious or unnerving, is well worth having. \n \nMohammed Hijab is an author, comparative religionist, and philosopher of scripture. He is the co-founder of the Sapience Institute and is a researcher and instructor for the organization. He has a BA in Politics and a master’s degree in History. He has also acquired a second master’s in Islamic Studies from the School of Oriental and African Studies, as well as a third master’s degree in Applied Theology from the University of Oxford. Currently, he is working toward his PhD in Philosophy of Religion. Having completed Islamic seminary courses, he is one of very few Muslims who has been given formal permission to relay Islamic knowledge on selected Islamic fields, dealing with comparative, political, and theological issues. In his efforts, he has amassed a substantial following on YouTube, aided in part by authoring books such as “The Scientific Deception of the New Atheists.”\n \nJonathan Pageau is a French-Canadian liturgical artist and icon carver, known for his work featured in museums across the world. He carves Eastern Orthodox and other traditional images and teaches an online carving class. He also runs a YouTube channel dedicated to the exploration of symbolism across history and religion.\n \n________________________________________________________________________\n\n—Links— \n\nFor

When the government shut him down for refusing to discriminate against his unvaccinated customers, the D.C. government shut him down and took all that away. After a nine-month legal battle, Eric has been allowed to reopen, but he’s continue to push the courts to acknowledge that what the city did was illegal so that it will that much harder for future administrations to deprive Americans of their basic rights of association, assembly, speech, and due process in the future.\n\nWatch Kibbe on Liberty on BlazeTV: https://blazetv.com/kibbe\nFollow Kibbe on Liberty on Facebook: https://facebook.com/KibbeBlazeTV\nFollow Free the People on YouTube: https://youtube.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Twitter: https://twitter.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Instagram: https://instagram.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Facebook: https://facebook.com/freethepeople\nVisit Free the People's Website: https://freethepeople.org\n\nKibbe on Liberty is a weekly podcast with libertarian author, economist, and community organizer Matt Kibbe. As the president of Free the People, Kibbe has decades of experience in the libertarian political sphere, but in these troubled times he believes that open dialogue is needed to bring people together. This means being willing to talk, and especially listen, to those with whom we might not always agree, trying to understand perspectives that might otherwise be foreign to us.\n\nKibbe on Liberty's growing roster of guests includes politicians, economists, comedians, writers, radio personalities, activists, journalists, and even a magician or two—with topics of conversation ranging from current affairs to craft beer and the Grateful Dead. So grab a cold one, and settle in for the next hour of Kibbe on Liberty, mostly honest conversations with mostly interesting people.","thumbnail":"https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/6CfoR0GDsRc/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"56","thumbCount":"8"},{"id":"9L36DuQb3LY","channelId":"UCyKgD0DLtBN21gfThSalyUQ","channelName":"Melissa Dougherty","title":"If Modern Vegans Acted Like Progressive Christians.","published":"2022-10-17T13:40:31+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T13:40:33+00:00","authorName":"Melissa Dougherty","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyKgD0DLtBN21gfThSalyUQ","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L36DuQb3LY","description":"It's impossible to be certain what vegans actually believe.

It has traditionally been a place where socialist left heavyweights could thrive, and burgeoning trade unions could flourish. \n\nSince the panic-stricken derailing of the Corbyn project and the mass expulsions and rule changes that brought with it, there is no longer any chance of a functioning left in the Labour party. \n\nThere’s no chance of even a nominal pushback of the prevailing state orthodoxy and nor will there ever be, again! Those still hoping any meaningful ground can be gained or that Starmer will be replaced by another Corbyn, are fooling themselves. \n\nOn the other hand, there are those who cling to the Labour ‘brand’, because it can still get them elected. We aim to change that! Anyone serious about challenging neoliberal state imperialism needs to bid a fond farewell to the lost Labour Party, brush themselves off, and come out fighting!","thumbnail":"https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/_JDZMeSxpA8/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"628","thumbCount":"94"},{"id":"OvMBRF43C7Y","channelId":"UCf_HItERkRB3vnkWt2RSOLg","channelName":"George Galloway","title":"FULL INTERVIEW:There’s not much that’s democratic or equitable about the #UN","published":"2022-10-17T16:00:20+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T16:00:20+00:00","authorName":"George Galloway","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf_HItERkRB3vnkWt2RSOLg","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvMBRF43C7Y","description":"\"FULL INTERVIEW: #Nato is not a defence alliance.

If you haven't seen Seasons 1 & 2, search \"The Chosen\" wherever you get your apps and on your streaming devices.\n \n“Come to me, you who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.” That's the theme of Season 3, and man, that applied to those of us making the show as well. It's taken a long time for Season 3 to get here, and believe me, it wasn't by choice. From supply chain issues affecting our construction, to Covid delays, to weather, the making of Season 3 for sure made us weary and heavy-laden. We don't get to escape the themes of each season.\n \nBut as you'll see from this trailer, I believe it was worth it. We launch Season Three in theaters, with Episodes 1 & 2 coming to most English-speaking countries on November 18 for a limited run on the big screen. And don't worry, if you can't see it in theaters, you'll soon after get it free and easy on streaming. So what are you going to see?\n \nSeason Three picks up where Season Two left off (you should watch that season if you haven't-—I promise Season Three will make more sense), with Jesus delivering the most famous sermon in history. What follows are the consequences of living out his teachings. The world changes because of this sermon, and the believers in (and enemies of) Jesus increase exponentially. This creates confusion, chaos, and yes, doubt, and we don't gloss over any of that in this season. I assure you, you're going to see some tough questions asked that you've no doubt experienced yourself. But...\n \nHe gives rest.\n \nThank you for your patience with this season. The good news is, while you've been waiting, literally tens of millions of people around the world have discovered The Chosen, and we are optimistic Season 3 will enlarge this movement even more. Be sure to watch this entire trailer for all the info you'll need to experience Season 3.

In this interview on Conversations That Matter with The New American magazine's Alex Newman, Rubacek describes her interviews with numerous sources in China--both victims and perpetrators--and how she stumbled upon the term \"Walking Dead\" used to describe the individuals who perpetrate these ghastly atrocities against their fellow human beings. Her new book examines how human beings could inflict such evil on others. Her new movie, meanwhile, focuses on providing hope. Rubacek hopes America will learn from the horrors of Communist China, as she warns that the United States could--in a worst-case scenario--end up like China. \n\n🇺🇸 The New

A woman apparently told responding officers that her son, 29-year-old Tyler Patrick, was acting delusional and banging on the house. Officers spoke with Patrick inside the residence and determined that he should be taken to a local hospital. As one officer, later identified as Off. George Kloos, tried to walk Patrick out of the residence, he swung a concealed [pocket] knife at the officer and stabbed Kloos in the neck. \n\nPatrick then attempted to stab two other officers as they tackled him onto a couch. Officers “wrestled” the knife out of his hand and took him into custody. Patrick was taken to the hospital for minor injuries he suffered during his arrest. He was treated, released and booked in the Montgomery County Jail. Patrick is facing three counts of felonious assault of a peace officer. Patrick appeared in court Friday afternoon where his bond was set at $500,000. He’s set to appear in court next on October 24, 2022. Officer Kloos, 10-year veteran of the force, was taken to Miami Valley Hospital and was released later that day. Doctors said the knife somehow missed the arteries in his neck. He is now home, and expected to make a full recovery.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nSpecial thanks to Shout-Out Supporters on Patreon:\n- Charles Cooper\n- Joe\n- Cooper Malley\n- Luis Perez\n- Chris Wesley\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity","thumbnail":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/UZ-jkQs3EvQ/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"268871","thumbCount":"8870"},{"id":"f6263LFJfuc","channelId":"UCc-0YpRpqgA5lPTpSQ5uo-Q","channelName":"Audit the Audit","title":"When Not Showing Your Receipt Goes HORRIBLY Wrong","published":"2022-10-17T13:00:22+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T13:00:22+00:00","authorName":"Audit the Audit","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-0YpRpqgA5lPTpSQ5uo-Q","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6263LFJfuc","description":"Second Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClTjur-9cx8Bb4MW8r0K6xw\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/audittheaudit\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AuditTheAudit\n\nSubmit your videos here: auditheaudit@gmail.com\n\nSponsorship inquiries: audit@ellify.com\n\nWelcome to Audit the Audit, where we sort out the who and what and the right and wrong of police interactions.

This is before as well, the technician, unfortunately, didn't have a clip of it afterward. \n0:23 Close to 110 psi / 7.5 bar in this tire that should only have around 3-35 psi. The tire light will still be on if the tires are overfilled.\n0:31 The technician said: \"All she told us is that she ran off the road and it wasn't at a bad angle so she didn't know why the airbags went off. We said that she had to have it so close to rolling over, the SDM thought it was rolling and deployed the airbags. Hard to get the full story out of a lot of these customers.\"\n0:46 The lower control arm was damaged (bent), the strut was completely broken and the tire had sidewall damage. The technician was driving it out of the after he quoted the repairs. \n1:02 The technician said this somehow drove in as well. The idler arm wasn't bolted to the center link, missing cotter pins and the toe was off due to the tie rod ends not being installed correctly.\n1:26 Bushings that needed to be replaced were for the lateral arms and transmission mount. The customer finally got them replaced as their \"fix\" didn't fix the clunking noise. The first time the customer declined repairs as they said they didn't like the quote. \n1:37 The technician said he has never seen this before and doesn't know what caused this as there seems to be no impact damage. As well these are the original steel wheels (OEM). \n1:53 The battery is too big so the battery posts touch the underneath of the hood which causes the sparks.\n2:00 A Toyota badge, Subaru wheel caps, and Scion steering wheel. \nThe technician it was actually a Scion FR-S\n2:13 The technician said: \"I don't know I never got the full story. The crazy thing is that truck was driven in like that. I quoted a new lower control arm, rotor, hub(it was obviously bent but you can't see that in the video but when you rotate the hub you can see the run out with just your eye), c/v boots (the outer boot was torn and slinging grease), brake line, and front strut assembly.  I also told the service writer there may be other parts messed up (steering knuckle or possibly upper control arm as well) and that I wouldn't be able to tell until I got the rest of it fixed and on the alignment machine.\"\n2:24 Surprising to see this in a company vehicle. The technician thinks it's wired like this so the person who drives this company vehicle can quickly/easily remove it if needed. What a terrible wiring job though!\n3:01 Not sure if the deer (doe) was okay or not since it ran away.\nThe viewer who shared this said it's something you would never believe if you didn't see it on camera. He said if he has time/remembers, he will give us an update. \n3:15 Outro.

They didn’t want to install a new one of their own making. So how did the Framers ensure that the President would have enough power to be an effective chief executive, without making him a dictator? John Yoo, Professor of Law at the University of California, Berkeley, has the answer.\n\n#prageru #president #constitution #history #americanhistory \n\nSUBSCRIBE 👉 https://www.prageru.com/join\n\nScript:\n\nHow much power should we give to the President? This was one of the most vexing (and critical) questions facing the Framers of the United States Constitution in the summer of 1787. \n\nTo be effective, the President had to be perceived—both in times of war and peace—as the leader of the nation. For this to happen, he would have to be given significant authority. Americans learned this lesson in the years following the Revolutionary War when the nation floundered under the Articles of Confederation which had no provision for a chief executive.\n\nBut this chief executive couldn’t be made so strong that he could become a tyrant. Americans fought a long and bloody war to get rid of one tyrant, the English King, George III. Nobody wanted to install a new one in his place. \n\nThe Framers answer is found in Article II.\n\nThe opening sentence reads as follows: “[t]he executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States.” This might sound straightforward, but it was anything but. \n\nHere’s why.\n\n“The vesting clause” of Article II, as it’s known, differs significantly from the vesting clause of Article I, which concerns the powers of Congress—the House of Representatives and the Senate. Article I’s vesting clause states: “all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States…” It then goes on to list those limited powers. That’s it. Congress can’t do anything else. \n\nThere are no such limitations specified in Article II. The difference is subtle, but important. \n\nWhereas Congress is given specific responsibilities, the President is given broad responsibilities and wide discretion as to how he fulfills them. This is part of his executive authority.\n\nAnd just what is that executive authority?\n\nThis is spelled out in Sections 2 and 3. \n\nThe President is the commander in chief of the armed services. He sets military policy. \n\nHe makes treaties with foreign countries. He sets foreign policy.\n\nHe appoints his own advisors—what became known as his cabinet. He sets domestic policy. \n\nHe appoints judges to the Supreme Court. That obviously gives him a big say in judicial policy.\n\nAnd finally, “he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” \n\nThis list is at once brief and vast because there’s so much involved in all these duties. Indeed, the President stands at the head of the entire administrative apparatus of the Federal government with all the rights and responsibilities that entails. For example, if the President can appoint federal officials, it stands to reason that he must be able to fire them, too. \n\nWhen you realize that enforcing the law involves layers and layers of people from department heads to federal law enforcement to government lawyers, all of whom are accountable to the President, you start to grasp how much power the chief executive has. \n\nSo, how did the Framers keep the President in check? \n\nFirst and foremost, they gave Congress “the power of the purse,” the power to fund the operations of the federal government. Congress can restrain the President by withholding funding. \n\nThe President literally can’t buy a light bulb for a lamp in the Oval Office without a Congressional appropriation. If the President proposes to add a new federal agency or to launch a war, Congress can bring his plans to a halt simply by refusing to fund them.  \n\nThe Constitution strikes a similar balance in foreign affairs. The President, as Commander-in-Chief, controls the strategy, tactics, and deployments of the U.S. Armed Forces, and also dictates U.S. foreign policy. Only Congress, however, has the power to declare war, and the Senate, by a two-thirds majority, must consent to any treaty negotiated by the President.\n\nCongress also has the power to impeach the President in cases of serious misconduct—treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. But the bar for impeachment is set very high to protect the President’s independence from Congress.\n\nFor the full script, visit: https://www.prageru.com/video/the-constitution-presidential-powers","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/ThKD3Py1HvA/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"3304","thumbCount":"781"},{"id":"OmMj5A0rquo","channelId":"UCdC0An4ZPNr_YiFiYoVbwaw","channelName":"Daily Dose Of Internet","title":"Halloween Decorations are Fighting Back","published":"2022-10-17T19:59:29+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T19:59:29+00:00","authorName":"Daily Dose Of Internet","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdC0An4ZPNr_YiFiYoVbwaw","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmMj5A0rquo","description":"Hello everyone, this is YOUR Daily Dose of Internet.

Peterson, Jonathan Pageau, and Mohammed Hijab discuss comparative religion, what is said about Islam versus what Islam has to say, and how the uncomfortable conversation - whether contentious or unnerving, is well worth having. \n \nMohammed Hijab is an author, comparative religionist, and philosopher of scripture. He is the co-founder of the Sapience Institute and is a researcher and instructor for the organization. He has a BA in Politics and a master’s degree in History. He has also acquired a second master’s in Islamic Studies from the School of Oriental and African Studies, as well as a third master’s degree in Applied Theology from the University of Oxford. Currently, he is working toward his PhD in Philosophy of Religion. Having completed Islamic seminary courses, he is one of very few Muslims who has been given formal permission to relay Islamic knowledge on selected Islamic fields, dealing with comparative, political, and theological issues. In his efforts, he has amassed a substantial following on YouTube, aided in part by authoring books such as “The Scientific Deception of the New Atheists.”\n \nJonathan Pageau is a French-Canadian liturgical artist and icon carver, known for his work featured in museums across the world. He carves Eastern Orthodox and other traditional images and teaches an online carving class. He also runs a YouTube channel dedicated to the exploration of symbolism across history and religion.\n \n________________________________________________________________________\n\n—Links— \n\nFor

When the government shut him down for refusing to discriminate against his unvaccinated customers, the D.C. government shut him down and took all that away. After a nine-month legal battle, Eric has been allowed to reopen, but he’s continue to push the courts to acknowledge that what the city did was illegal so that it will that much harder for future administrations to deprive Americans of their basic rights of association, assembly, speech, and due process in the future.\n\nWatch Kibbe on Liberty on BlazeTV: https://blazetv.com/kibbe\nFollow Kibbe on Liberty on Facebook: https://facebook.com/KibbeBlazeTV\nFollow Free the People on YouTube: https://youtube.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Twitter: https://twitter.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Instagram: https://instagram.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Facebook: https://facebook.com/freethepeople\nVisit Free the People's Website: https://freethepeople.org\n\nKibbe on Liberty is a weekly podcast with libertarian author, economist, and community organizer Matt Kibbe. As the president of Free the People, Kibbe has decades of experience in the libertarian political sphere, but in these troubled times he believes that open dialogue is needed to bring people together. This means being willing to talk, and especially listen, to those with whom we might not always agree, trying to understand perspectives that might otherwise be foreign to us.\n\nKibbe on Liberty's growing roster of guests includes politicians, economists, comedians, writers, radio personalities, activists, journalists, and even a magician or two—with topics of conversation ranging from current affairs to craft beer and the Grateful Dead. So grab a cold one, and settle in for the next hour of Kibbe on Liberty, mostly honest conversations with mostly interesting people.","thumbnail":"https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/6CfoR0GDsRc/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"56","thumbCount":"8"},{"id":"9L36DuQb3LY","channelId":"UCyKgD0DLtBN21gfThSalyUQ","channelName":"Melissa Dougherty","title":"If Modern Vegans Acted Like Progressive Christians.","published":"2022-10-17T13:40:31+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T13:40:33+00:00","authorName":"Melissa Dougherty","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyKgD0DLtBN21gfThSalyUQ","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L36DuQb3LY","description":"It's impossible to be certain what vegans actually believe.

It has traditionally been a place where socialist left heavyweights could thrive, and burgeoning trade unions could flourish. \n\nSince the panic-stricken derailing of the Corbyn project and the mass expulsions and rule changes that brought with it, there is no longer any chance of a functioning left in the Labour party. \n\nThere’s no chance of even a nominal pushback of the prevailing state orthodoxy and nor will there ever be, again! Those still hoping any meaningful ground can be gained or that Starmer will be replaced by another Corbyn, are fooling themselves. \n\nOn the other hand, there are those who cling to the Labour ‘brand’, because it can still get them elected. We aim to change that! Anyone serious about challenging neoliberal state imperialism needs to bid a fond farewell to the lost Labour Party, brush themselves off, and come out fighting!","thumbnail":"https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/_JDZMeSxpA8/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"628","thumbCount":"94"},{"id":"OvMBRF43C7Y","channelId":"UCf_HItERkRB3vnkWt2RSOLg","channelName":"George Galloway","title":"FULL INTERVIEW:There’s not much that’s democratic or equitable about the #UN","published":"2022-10-17T16:00:20+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T16:00:20+00:00","authorName":"George Galloway","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf_HItERkRB3vnkWt2RSOLg","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvMBRF43C7Y","description":"\"FULL INTERVIEW: #Nato is not a defence alliance.

If you haven't seen Seasons 1 & 2, search \"The Chosen\" wherever you get your apps and on your streaming devices.\n \n“Come to me, you who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.” That's the theme of Season 3, and man, that applied to those of us making the show as well. It's taken a long time for Season 3 to get here, and believe me, it wasn't by choice. From supply chain issues affecting our construction, to Covid delays, to weather, the making of Season 3 for sure made us weary and heavy-laden. We don't get to escape the themes of each season.\n \nBut as you'll see from this trailer, I believe it was worth it. We launch Season Three in theaters, with Episodes 1 & 2 coming to most English-speaking countries on November 18 for a limited run on the big screen. And don't worry, if you can't see it in theaters, you'll soon after get it free and easy on streaming. So what are you going to see?\n \nSeason Three picks up where Season Two left off (you should watch that season if you haven't-—I promise Season Three will make more sense), with Jesus delivering the most famous sermon in history. What follows are the consequences of living out his teachings. The world changes because of this sermon, and the believers in (and enemies of) Jesus increase exponentially. This creates confusion, chaos, and yes, doubt, and we don't gloss over any of that in this season. I assure you, you're going to see some tough questions asked that you've no doubt experienced yourself. But...\n \nHe gives rest.\n \nThank you for your patience with this season. The good news is, while you've been waiting, literally tens of millions of people around the world have discovered The Chosen, and we are optimistic Season 3 will enlarge this movement even more. Be sure to watch this entire trailer for all the info you'll need to experience Season 3.

In this interview on Conversations That Matter with The New American magazine's Alex Newman, Rubacek describes her interviews with numerous sources in China--both victims and perpetrators--and how she stumbled upon the term \"Walking Dead\" used to describe the individuals who perpetrate these ghastly atrocities against their fellow human beings. Her new book examines how human beings could inflict such evil on others. Her new movie, meanwhile, focuses on providing hope. Rubacek hopes America will learn from the horrors of Communist China, as she warns that the United States could--in a worst-case scenario--end up like China. \n\n🇺🇸 The New

A woman apparently told responding officers that her son, 29-year-old Tyler Patrick, was acting delusional and banging on the house. Officers spoke with Patrick inside the residence and determined that he should be taken to a local hospital. As one officer, later identified as Off. George Kloos, tried to walk Patrick out of the residence, he swung a concealed [pocket] knife at the officer and stabbed Kloos in the neck. \n\nPatrick then attempted to stab two other officers as they tackled him onto a couch. Officers “wrestled” the knife out of his hand and took him into custody. Patrick was taken to the hospital for minor injuries he suffered during his arrest. He was treated, released and booked in the Montgomery County Jail. Patrick is facing three counts of felonious assault of a peace officer. Patrick appeared in court Friday afternoon where his bond was set at $500,000. He’s set to appear in court next on October 24, 2022. Officer Kloos, 10-year veteran of the force, was taken to Miami Valley Hospital and was released later that day. Doctors said the knife somehow missed the arteries in his neck. He is now home, and expected to make a full recovery.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nSpecial thanks to Shout-Out Supporters on Patreon:\n- Charles Cooper\n- Joe\n- Cooper Malley\n- Luis Perez\n- Chris Wesley\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity","thumbnail":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/UZ-jkQs3EvQ/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"268871","thumbCount":"8870"},{"id":"f6263LFJfuc","channelId":"UCc-0YpRpqgA5lPTpSQ5uo-Q","channelName":"Audit the Audit","title":"When Not Showing Your Receipt Goes HORRIBLY Wrong","published":"2022-10-17T13:00:22+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T13:00:22+00:00","authorName":"Audit the Audit","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-0YpRpqgA5lPTpSQ5uo-Q","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6263LFJfuc","description":"Second Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClTjur-9cx8Bb4MW8r0K6xw\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/audittheaudit\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AuditTheAudit\n\nSubmit your videos here: auditheaudit@gmail.com\n\nSponsorship inquiries: audit@ellify.com\n\nWelcome to Audit the Audit, where we sort out the who and what and the right and wrong of police interactions.

This is before as well, the technician, unfortunately, didn't have a clip of it afterward. \n0:23 Close to 110 psi / 7.5 bar in this tire that should only have around 3-35 psi. The tire light will still be on if the tires are overfilled.\n0:31 The technician said: \"All she told us is that she ran off the road and it wasn't at a bad angle so she didn't know why the airbags went off. We said that she had to have it so close to rolling over, the SDM thought it was rolling and deployed the airbags. Hard to get the full story out of a lot of these customers.\"\n0:46 The lower control arm was damaged (bent), the strut was completely broken and the tire had sidewall damage. The technician was driving it out of the after he quoted the repairs. \n1:02 The technician said this somehow drove in as well. The idler arm wasn't bolted to the center link, missing cotter pins and the toe was off due to the tie rod ends not being installed correctly.\n1:26 Bushings that needed to be replaced were for the lateral arms and transmission mount. The customer finally got them replaced as their \"fix\" didn't fix the clunking noise. The first time the customer declined repairs as they said they didn't like the quote. \n1:37 The technician said he has never seen this before and doesn't know what caused this as there seems to be no impact damage. As well these are the original steel wheels (OEM). \n1:53 The battery is too big so the battery posts touch the underneath of the hood which causes the sparks.\n2:00 A Toyota badge, Subaru wheel caps, and Scion steering wheel. \nThe technician it was actually a Scion FR-S\n2:13 The technician said: \"I don't know I never got the full story. The crazy thing is that truck was driven in like that. I quoted a new lower control arm, rotor, hub(it was obviously bent but you can't see that in the video but when you rotate the hub you can see the run out with just your eye), c/v boots (the outer boot was torn and slinging grease), brake line, and front strut assembly.  I also told the service writer there may be other parts messed up (steering knuckle or possibly upper control arm as well) and that I wouldn't be able to tell until I got the rest of it fixed and on the alignment machine.\"\n2:24 Surprising to see this in a company vehicle. The technician thinks it's wired like this so the person who drives this company vehicle can quickly/easily remove it if needed. What a terrible wiring job though!\n3:01 Not sure if the deer (doe) was okay or not since it ran away.\nThe viewer who shared this said it's something you would never believe if you didn't see it on camera. He said if he has time/remembers, he will give us an update. \n3:15 Outro.

They didn’t want to install a new one of their own making. So how did the Framers ensure that the President would have enough power to be an effective chief executive, without making him a dictator? John Yoo, Professor of Law at the University of California, Berkeley, has the answer.\n\n#prageru #president #constitution #history #americanhistory \n\nSUBSCRIBE 👉 https://www.prageru.com/join\n\nScript:\n\nHow much power should we give to the President? This was one of the most vexing (and critical) questions facing the Framers of the United States Constitution in the summer of 1787. \n\nTo be effective, the President had to be perceived—both in times of war and peace—as the leader of the nation. For this to happen, he would have to be given significant authority. Americans learned this lesson in the years following the Revolutionary War when the nation floundered under the Articles of Confederation which had no provision for a chief executive.\n\nBut this chief executive couldn’t be made so strong that he could become a tyrant. Americans fought a long and bloody war to get rid of one tyrant, the English King, George III. Nobody wanted to install a new one in his place. \n\nThe Framers answer is found in Article II.\n\nThe opening sentence reads as follows: “[t]he executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States.” This might sound straightforward, but it was anything but. \n\nHere’s why.\n\n“The vesting clause” of Article II, as it’s known, differs significantly from the vesting clause of Article I, which concerns the powers of Congress—the House of Representatives and the Senate. Article I’s vesting clause states: “all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States…” It then goes on to list those limited powers. That’s it. Congress can’t do anything else. \n\nThere are no such limitations specified in Article II. The difference is subtle, but important. \n\nWhereas Congress is given specific responsibilities, the President is given broad responsibilities and wide discretion as to how he fulfills them. This is part of his executive authority.\n\nAnd just what is that executive authority?\n\nThis is spelled out in Sections 2 and 3. \n\nThe President is the commander in chief of the armed services. He sets military policy. \n\nHe makes treaties with foreign countries. He sets foreign policy.\n\nHe appoints his own advisors—what became known as his cabinet. He sets domestic policy. \n\nHe appoints judges to the Supreme Court. That obviously gives him a big say in judicial policy.\n\nAnd finally, “he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” \n\nThis list is at once brief and vast because there’s so much involved in all these duties. Indeed, the President stands at the head of the entire administrative apparatus of the Federal government with all the rights and responsibilities that entails. For example, if the President can appoint federal officials, it stands to reason that he must be able to fire them, too. \n\nWhen you realize that enforcing the law involves layers and layers of people from department heads to federal law enforcement to government lawyers, all of whom are accountable to the President, you start to grasp how much power the chief executive has. \n\nSo, how did the Framers keep the President in check? \n\nFirst and foremost, they gave Congress “the power of the purse,” the power to fund the operations of the federal government. Congress can restrain the President by withholding funding. \n\nThe President literally can’t buy a light bulb for a lamp in the Oval Office without a Congressional appropriation. If the President proposes to add a new federal agency or to launch a war, Congress can bring his plans to a halt simply by refusing to fund them.  \n\nThe Constitution strikes a similar balance in foreign affairs. The President, as Commander-in-Chief, controls the strategy, tactics, and deployments of the U.S. Armed Forces, and also dictates U.S. foreign policy. Only Congress, however, has the power to declare war, and the Senate, by a two-thirds majority, must consent to any treaty negotiated by the President.\n\nCongress also has the power to impeach the President in cases of serious misconduct—treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. But the bar for impeachment is set very high to protect the President’s independence from Congress.\n\nFor the full script, visit: https://www.prageru.com/video/the-constitution-presidential-powers","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/ThKD3Py1HvA/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"3304","thumbCount":"781"},{"id":"OmMj5A0rquo","channelId":"UCdC0An4ZPNr_YiFiYoVbwaw","channelName":"Daily Dose Of Internet","title":"Halloween Decorations are Fighting Back","published":"2022-10-17T19:59:29+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T19:59:29+00:00","authorName":"Daily Dose Of Internet","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdC0An4ZPNr_YiFiYoVbwaw","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmMj5A0rquo","description":"Hello everyone, this is YOUR Daily Dose of Internet.

Peterson, Jonathan Pageau, and Mohammed Hijab discuss comparative religion, what is said about Islam versus what Islam has to say, and how the uncomfortable conversation - whether contentious or unnerving, is well worth having. \n \nMohammed Hijab is an author, comparative religionist, and philosopher of scripture. He is the co-founder of the Sapience Institute and is a researcher and instructor for the organization. He has a BA in Politics and a master’s degree in History. He has also acquired a second master’s in Islamic Studies from the School of Oriental and African Studies, as well as a third master’s degree in Applied Theology from the University of Oxford. Currently, he is working toward his PhD in Philosophy of Religion. Having completed Islamic seminary courses, he is one of very few Muslims who has been given formal permission to relay Islamic knowledge on selected Islamic fields, dealing with comparative, political, and theological issues. In his efforts, he has amassed a substantial following on YouTube, aided in part by authoring books such as “The Scientific Deception of the New Atheists.”\n \nJonathan Pageau is a French-Canadian liturgical artist and icon carver, known for his work featured in museums across the world. He carves Eastern Orthodox and other traditional images and teaches an online carving class. He also runs a YouTube channel dedicated to the exploration of symbolism across history and religion.\n \n________________________________________________________________________\n\n—Links— \n\nFor

When the government shut him down for refusing to discriminate against his unvaccinated customers, the D.C. government shut him down and took all that away. After a nine-month legal battle, Eric has been allowed to reopen, but he’s continue to push the courts to acknowledge that what the city did was illegal so that it will that much harder for future administrations to deprive Americans of their basic rights of association, assembly, speech, and due process in the future.\n\nWatch Kibbe on Liberty on BlazeTV: https://blazetv.com/kibbe\nFollow Kibbe on Liberty on Facebook: https://facebook.com/KibbeBlazeTV\nFollow Free the People on YouTube: https://youtube.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Twitter: https://twitter.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Instagram: https://instagram.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Facebook: https://facebook.com/freethepeople\nVisit Free the People's Website: https://freethepeople.org\n\nKibbe on Liberty is a weekly podcast with libertarian author, economist, and community organizer Matt Kibbe. As the president of Free the People, Kibbe has decades of experience in the libertarian political sphere, but in these troubled times he believes that open dialogue is needed to bring people together. This means being willing to talk, and especially listen, to those with whom we might not always agree, trying to understand perspectives that might otherwise be foreign to us.\n\nKibbe on Liberty's growing roster of guests includes politicians, economists, comedians, writers, radio personalities, activists, journalists, and even a magician or two—with topics of conversation ranging from current affairs to craft beer and the Grateful Dead. So grab a cold one, and settle in for the next hour of Kibbe on Liberty, mostly honest conversations with mostly interesting people.","thumbnail":"https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/6CfoR0GDsRc/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"56","thumbCount":"8"},{"id":"9L36DuQb3LY","channelId":"UCyKgD0DLtBN21gfThSalyUQ","channelName":"Melissa Dougherty","title":"If Modern Vegans Acted Like Progressive Christians.","published":"2022-10-17T13:40:31+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T13:40:33+00:00","authorName":"Melissa Dougherty","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyKgD0DLtBN21gfThSalyUQ","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L36DuQb3LY","description":"It's impossible to be certain what vegans actually believe.

It has traditionally been a place where socialist left heavyweights could thrive, and burgeoning trade unions could flourish. \n\nSince the panic-stricken derailing of the Corbyn project and the mass expulsions and rule changes that brought with it, there is no longer any chance of a functioning left in the Labour party. \n\nThere’s no chance of even a nominal pushback of the prevailing state orthodoxy and nor will there ever be, again! Those still hoping any meaningful ground can be gained or that Starmer will be replaced by another Corbyn, are fooling themselves. \n\nOn the other hand, there are those who cling to the Labour ‘brand’, because it can still get them elected. We aim to change that! Anyone serious about challenging neoliberal state imperialism needs to bid a fond farewell to the lost Labour Party, brush themselves off, and come out fighting!","thumbnail":"https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/_JDZMeSxpA8/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"628","thumbCount":"94"},{"id":"OvMBRF43C7Y","channelId":"UCf_HItERkRB3vnkWt2RSOLg","channelName":"George Galloway","title":"FULL INTERVIEW:There’s not much that’s democratic or equitable about the #UN","published":"2022-10-17T16:00:20+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T16:00:20+00:00","authorName":"George Galloway","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf_HItERkRB3vnkWt2RSOLg","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvMBRF43C7Y","description":"\"FULL INTERVIEW: #Nato is not a defence alliance.

If you haven't seen Seasons 1 & 2, search \"The Chosen\" wherever you get your apps and on your streaming devices.\n \n“Come to me, you who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.” That's the theme of Season 3, and man, that applied to those of us making the show as well. It's taken a long time for Season 3 to get here, and believe me, it wasn't by choice. From supply chain issues affecting our construction, to Covid delays, to weather, the making of Season 3 for sure made us weary and heavy-laden. We don't get to escape the themes of each season.\n \nBut as you'll see from this trailer, I believe it was worth it. We launch Season Three in theaters, with Episodes 1 & 2 coming to most English-speaking countries on November 18 for a limited run on the big screen. And don't worry, if you can't see it in theaters, you'll soon after get it free and easy on streaming. So what are you going to see?\n \nSeason Three picks up where Season Two left off (you should watch that season if you haven't-—I promise Season Three will make more sense), with Jesus delivering the most famous sermon in history. What follows are the consequences of living out his teachings. The world changes because of this sermon, and the believers in (and enemies of) Jesus increase exponentially. This creates confusion, chaos, and yes, doubt, and we don't gloss over any of that in this season. I assure you, you're going to see some tough questions asked that you've no doubt experienced yourself. But...\n \nHe gives rest.\n \nThank you for your patience with this season. The good news is, while you've been waiting, literally tens of millions of people around the world have discovered The Chosen, and we are optimistic Season 3 will enlarge this movement even more. Be sure to watch this entire trailer for all the info you'll need to experience Season 3.

In this interview on Conversations That Matter with The New American magazine's Alex Newman, Rubacek describes her interviews with numerous sources in China--both victims and perpetrators--and how she stumbled upon the term \"Walking Dead\" used to describe the individuals who perpetrate these ghastly atrocities against their fellow human beings. Her new book examines how human beings could inflict such evil on others. Her new movie, meanwhile, focuses on providing hope. Rubacek hopes America will learn from the horrors of Communist China, as she warns that the United States could--in a worst-case scenario--end up like China. \n\n🇺🇸 The New

A woman apparently told responding officers that her son, 29-year-old Tyler Patrick, was acting delusional and banging on the house. Officers spoke with Patrick inside the residence and determined that he should be taken to a local hospital. As one officer, later identified as Off. George Kloos, tried to walk Patrick out of the residence, he swung a concealed [pocket] knife at the officer and stabbed Kloos in the neck. \n\nPatrick then attempted to stab two other officers as they tackled him onto a couch. Officers “wrestled” the knife out of his hand and took him into custody. Patrick was taken to the hospital for minor injuries he suffered during his arrest. He was treated, released and booked in the Montgomery County Jail. Patrick is facing three counts of felonious assault of a peace officer. Patrick appeared in court Friday afternoon where his bond was set at $500,000. He’s set to appear in court next on October 24, 2022. Officer Kloos, 10-year veteran of the force, was taken to Miami Valley Hospital and was released later that day. Doctors said the knife somehow missed the arteries in his neck. He is now home, and expected to make a full recovery.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nSpecial thanks to Shout-Out Supporters on Patreon:\n- Charles Cooper\n- Joe\n- Cooper Malley\n- Luis Perez\n- Chris Wesley\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Police_Activity","thumbnail":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/UZ-jkQs3EvQ/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"268871","thumbCount":"8870"},{"id":"f6263LFJfuc","channelId":"UCc-0YpRpqgA5lPTpSQ5uo-Q","channelName":"Audit the Audit","title":"When Not Showing Your Receipt Goes HORRIBLY Wrong","published":"2022-10-17T13:00:22+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T13:00:22+00:00","authorName":"Audit the Audit","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-0YpRpqgA5lPTpSQ5uo-Q","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6263LFJfuc","description":"Second Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClTjur-9cx8Bb4MW8r0K6xw\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/audittheaudit\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AuditTheAudit\n\nSubmit your videos here: auditheaudit@gmail.com\n\nSponsorship inquiries: audit@ellify.com\n\nWelcome to Audit the Audit, where we sort out the who and what and the right and wrong of police interactions.

This is before as well, the technician, unfortunately, didn't have a clip of it afterward. \n0:23 Close to 110 psi / 7.5 bar in this tire that should only have around 3-35 psi. The tire light will still be on if the tires are overfilled.\n0:31 The technician said: \"All she told us is that she ran off the road and it wasn't at a bad angle so she didn't know why the airbags went off. We said that she had to have it so close to rolling over, the SDM thought it was rolling and deployed the airbags. Hard to get the full story out of a lot of these customers.\"\n0:46 The lower control arm was damaged (bent), the strut was completely broken and the tire had sidewall damage. The technician was driving it out of the after he quoted the repairs. \n1:02 The technician said this somehow drove in as well. The idler arm wasn't bolted to the center link, missing cotter pins and the toe was off due to the tie rod ends not being installed correctly.\n1:26 Bushings that needed to be replaced were for the lateral arms and transmission mount. The customer finally got them replaced as their \"fix\" didn't fix the clunking noise. The first time the customer declined repairs as they said they didn't like the quote. \n1:37 The technician said he has never seen this before and doesn't know what caused this as there seems to be no impact damage. As well these are the original steel wheels (OEM). \n1:53 The battery is too big so the battery posts touch the underneath of the hood which causes the sparks.\n2:00 A Toyota badge, Subaru wheel caps, and Scion steering wheel. \nThe technician it was actually a Scion FR-S\n2:13 The technician said: \"I don't know I never got the full story. The crazy thing is that truck was driven in like that. I quoted a new lower control arm, rotor, hub(it was obviously bent but you can't see that in the video but when you rotate the hub you can see the run out with just your eye), c/v boots (the outer boot was torn and slinging grease), brake line, and front strut assembly.  I also told the service writer there may be other parts messed up (steering knuckle or possibly upper control arm as well) and that I wouldn't be able to tell until I got the rest of it fixed and on the alignment machine.\"\n2:24 Surprising to see this in a company vehicle. The technician thinks it's wired like this so the person who drives this company vehicle can quickly/easily remove it if needed. What a terrible wiring job though!\n3:01 Not sure if the deer (doe) was okay or not since it ran away.\nThe viewer who shared this said it's something you would never believe if you didn't see it on camera. He said if he has time/remembers, he will give us an update. \n3:15 Outro.

They didn’t want to install a new one of their own making. So how did the Framers ensure that the President would have enough power to be an effective chief executive, without making him a dictator? John Yoo, Professor of Law at the University of California, Berkeley, has the answer.\n\n#prageru #president #constitution #history #americanhistory \n\nSUBSCRIBE 👉 https://www.prageru.com/join\n\nScript:\n\nHow much power should we give to the President? This was one of the most vexing (and critical) questions facing the Framers of the United States Constitution in the summer of 1787. \n\nTo be effective, the President had to be perceived—both in times of war and peace—as the leader of the nation. For this to happen, he would have to be given significant authority. Americans learned this lesson in the years following the Revolutionary War when the nation floundered under the Articles of Confederation which had no provision for a chief executive.\n\nBut this chief executive couldn’t be made so strong that he could become a tyrant. Americans fought a long and bloody war to get rid of one tyrant, the English King, George III. Nobody wanted to install a new one in his place. \n\nThe Framers answer is found in Article II.\n\nThe opening sentence reads as follows: “[t]he executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States.” This might sound straightforward, but it was anything but. \n\nHere’s why.\n\n“The vesting clause” of Article II, as it’s known, differs significantly from the vesting clause of Article I, which concerns the powers of Congress—the House of Representatives and the Senate. Article I’s vesting clause states: “all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States…” It then goes on to list those limited powers. That’s it. Congress can’t do anything else. \n\nThere are no such limitations specified in Article II. The difference is subtle, but important. \n\nWhereas Congress is given specific responsibilities, the President is given broad responsibilities and wide discretion as to how he fulfills them. This is part of his executive authority.\n\nAnd just what is that executive authority?\n\nThis is spelled out in Sections 2 and 3. \n\nThe President is the commander in chief of the armed services. He sets military policy. \n\nHe makes treaties with foreign countries. He sets foreign policy.\n\nHe appoints his own advisors—what became known as his cabinet. He sets domestic policy. \n\nHe appoints judges to the Supreme Court. That obviously gives him a big say in judicial policy.\n\nAnd finally, “he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” \n\nThis list is at once brief and vast because there’s so much involved in all these duties. Indeed, the President stands at the head of the entire administrative apparatus of the Federal government with all the rights and responsibilities that entails. For example, if the President can appoint federal officials, it stands to reason that he must be able to fire them, too. \n\nWhen you realize that enforcing the law involves layers and layers of people from department heads to federal law enforcement to government lawyers, all of whom are accountable to the President, you start to grasp how much power the chief executive has. \n\nSo, how did the Framers keep the President in check? \n\nFirst and foremost, they gave Congress “the power of the purse,” the power to fund the operations of the federal government. Congress can restrain the President by withholding funding. \n\nThe President literally can’t buy a light bulb for a lamp in the Oval Office without a Congressional appropriation. If the President proposes to add a new federal agency or to launch a war, Congress can bring his plans to a halt simply by refusing to fund them.  \n\nThe Constitution strikes a similar balance in foreign affairs. The President, as Commander-in-Chief, controls the strategy, tactics, and deployments of the U.S. Armed Forces, and also dictates U.S. foreign policy. Only Congress, however, has the power to declare war, and the Senate, by a two-thirds majority, must consent to any treaty negotiated by the President.\n\nCongress also has the power to impeach the President in cases of serious misconduct—treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. But the bar for impeachment is set very high to protect the President’s independence from Congress.\n\nFor the full script, visit: https://www.prageru.com/video/the-constitution-presidential-powers","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/ThKD3Py1HvA/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"3304","thumbCount":"781"},{"id":"OmMj5A0rquo","channelId":"UCdC0An4ZPNr_YiFiYoVbwaw","channelName":"Daily Dose Of Internet","title":"Halloween Decorations are Fighting Back","published":"2022-10-17T19:59:29+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T19:59:29+00:00","authorName":"Daily Dose Of Internet","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdC0An4ZPNr_YiFiYoVbwaw","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmMj5A0rquo","description":"Hello everyone, this is YOUR Daily Dose of Internet.

Peterson, Jonathan Pageau, and Mohammed Hijab discuss comparative religion, what is said about Islam versus what Islam has to say, and how the uncomfortable conversation - whether contentious or unnerving, is well worth having. \n \nMohammed Hijab is an author, comparative religionist, and philosopher of scripture. He is the co-founder of the Sapience Institute and is a researcher and instructor for the organization. He has a BA in Politics and a master’s degree in History. He has also acquired a second master’s in Islamic Studies from the School of Oriental and African Studies, as well as a third master’s degree in Applied Theology from the University of Oxford. Currently, he is working toward his PhD in Philosophy of Religion. Having completed Islamic seminary courses, he is one of very few Muslims who has been given formal permission to relay Islamic knowledge on selected Islamic fields, dealing with comparative, political, and theological issues. In his efforts, he has amassed a substantial following on YouTube, aided in part by authoring books such as “The Scientific Deception of the New Atheists.”\n \nJonathan Pageau is a French-Canadian liturgical artist and icon carver, known for his work featured in museums across the world. He carves Eastern Orthodox and other traditional images and teaches an online carving class. He also runs a YouTube channel dedicated to the exploration of symbolism across history and religion.\n \n________________________________________________________________________\n\n—Links— \n\nFor

When the government shut him down for refusing to discriminate against his unvaccinated customers, the D.C. government shut him down and took all that away. After a nine-month legal battle, Eric has been allowed to reopen, but he’s continue to push the courts to acknowledge that what the city did was illegal so that it will that much harder for future administrations to deprive Americans of their basic rights of association, assembly, speech, and due process in the future.\n\nWatch Kibbe on Liberty on BlazeTV: https://blazetv.com/kibbe\nFollow Kibbe on Liberty on Facebook: https://facebook.com/KibbeBlazeTV\nFollow Free the People on YouTube: https://youtube.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Twitter: https://twitter.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Instagram: https://instagram.com/freethepeople\nFollow Free the People on Facebook: https://facebook.com/freethepeople\nVisit Free the People's Website: https://freethepeople.org\n\nKibbe on Liberty is a weekly podcast with libertarian author, economist, and community organizer Matt Kibbe. As the president of Free the People, Kibbe has decades of experience in the libertarian political sphere, but in these troubled times he believes that open dialogue is needed to bring people together. This means being willing to talk, and especially listen, to those with whom we might not always agree, trying to understand perspectives that might otherwise be foreign to us.\n\nKibbe on Liberty's growing roster of guests includes politicians, economists, comedians, writers, radio personalities, activists, journalists, and even a magician or two—with topics of conversation ranging from current affairs to craft beer and the Grateful Dead. So grab a cold one, and settle in for the next hour of Kibbe on Liberty, mostly honest conversations with mostly interesting people.","thumbnail":"https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/6CfoR0GDsRc/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"56","thumbCount":"8"},{"id":"9L36DuQb3LY","channelId":"UCyKgD0DLtBN21gfThSalyUQ","channelName":"Melissa Dougherty","title":"If Modern Vegans Acted Like Progressive Christians.","published":"2022-10-17T13:40:31+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T13:40:33+00:00","authorName":"Melissa Dougherty","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyKgD0DLtBN21gfThSalyUQ","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L36DuQb3LY","description":"It's impossible to be certain what vegans actually believe.

It has traditionally been a place where socialist left heavyweights could thrive, and burgeoning trade unions could flourish. \n\nSince the panic-stricken derailing of the Corbyn project and the mass expulsions and rule changes that brought with it, there is no longer any chance of a functioning left in the Labour party. \n\nThere’s no chance of even a nominal pushback of the prevailing state orthodoxy and nor will there ever be, again! Those still hoping any meaningful ground can be gained or that Starmer will be replaced by another Corbyn, are fooling themselves. \n\nOn the other hand, there are those who cling to the Labour ‘brand’, because it can still get them elected. We aim to change that! Anyone serious about challenging neoliberal state imperialism needs to bid a fond farewell to the lost Labour Party, brush themselves off, and come out fighting!","thumbnail":"https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/_JDZMeSxpA8/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"628","thumbCount":"94"},{"id":"OvMBRF43C7Y","channelId":"UCf_HItERkRB3vnkWt2RSOLg","channelName":"George Galloway","title":"FULL INTERVIEW:There’s not much that’s democratic or equitable about the #UN","published":"2022-10-17T16:00:20+00:00","updated":"2022-10-17T16:00:20+00:00","authorName":"George Galloway","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf_HItERkRB3vnkWt2RSOLg","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvMBRF43C7Y","description":"\"FULL INTERVIEW: #Nato is not a defence alliance.

If you haven't seen Seasons 1 & 2, search \"The Chosen\" wherever you get your apps and on your streaming devices.\n \n“Come to me, you who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.” That's the theme of Season 3, and man, that applied to those of us making the show as well. It's taken a long time for Season 3 to get here, and believe me, it wasn't by choice. From supply chain issues affecting our construction, to Covid delays, to weather, the making of Season 3 for sure made us weary and heavy-laden. We don't get to escape the themes of each season.\n \nBut as you'll see from this trailer, I believe it was worth it. We launch Season Three in theaters, with Episodes 1 & 2 coming to most English-speaking countries on November 18 for a limited run on the big screen. And don't worry, if you can't see it in theaters, you'll soon after get it free and easy on streaming. So what are you going to see?\n \nSeason Three picks up where Season Two left off (you should watch that season if you haven't-—I promise Season Three will make more sense), with Jesus delivering the most famous sermon in history. What follows are the consequences of living out his teachings. The world changes because of this sermon, and the believers in (and enemies of) Jesus increase exponentially. This creates confusion, chaos, and yes, doubt, and we don't gloss over any of that in this season. I assure you, you're going to see some tough questions asked that you've no doubt experienced yourself. But...\n \nHe gives rest.\n \nThank you for your patience with this season. The good news is, while you've been waiting, literally tens of millions of people around the world have discovered The Chosen, and we are optimistic Season 3 will enlarge this movement even more. Be sure to watch this entire trailer for all the info you'll need to experience Season 3.

In this interview on Conversations That Matter with The New American magazine's Alex Newman, Rubacek describes her interviews with numerous sources in China--both victims and perpetrators--and how she stumbled upon the term \"Walking Dead\" used to describe the individuals who perpetrate these ghastly atrocities against their fellow human beings. Her new book examines how human beings could inflict such evil on others. Her new movie, meanwhile, focuses on providing hope. Rubacek hopes America will learn from the horrors of Communist China, as she warns that the United States could--in a worst-case scenario--end up like China. \n\n🇺🇸 The New
