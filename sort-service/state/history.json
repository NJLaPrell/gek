Thanks to Scopely for sponsoring this video - Download Star Trek Fleet Command on iOS & Android and battle in the Star Trek universe here: https://pixly.go2cloud.org/SH3Nj\n\nIn antiquity, very little was known of the distant north. Most of what trickled down into the Mediterranean world were various trade goods and rumors carried by merchants. However the prospects of what lay beyond soon attracted explorers to seek out the riches of the mysterious beyond. Himilco of Carthage was among the first to launch an Phoenician expedition into the Atlantic which may have reached as far as Brittany. Yet around 320 BC Pytheas of Massalia would launch his own Greek expedition which would penetrate as far as the Arctic.\n\nIn this history documentary we bring to life his journey as it made its way from the warm shores of the Mediterranean to the frigid depths of the Congealed Sea and beyond! \n\nRelated videos:\nRomans in Africa https://youtu.be/3LBwDqRCx94\nCarthaginian Exploration https://youtu.be/TSYqAFSQVj0\n\nSources and Suggested Reading:\n\"The Extraordinary Voyage of Pytheas the Greek\" by Barry Cunliffe\n‚ÄúGeography‚Äù by Strabo\n‚ÄúThe Natural History‚Äù by Pliny the Elder\n‚ÄúHistories‚Äù by Herodotus\n\nCredits:\nResearch = Invicta \nWriting = Invicta\nNarration = Invicta\nArtwork = Gabriel Cassata\n\n#history \n#documentary \n#explore","thumbnail":"https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/s5ROBinkhBE/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":"2422","thumbCount":"349"},{"id":"T29sE1NM6oE","playlistItemId":"","channelId":"UCJ0kmBes7vSjT3QoWDfjwwg","channelName":"The New American Video","title":"Big Win for Parental Rights at Idaho Supreme Court","published":"2022-10-19T21:00:25+00:00","updated":"2022-10-19T21:00:25+00:00","authorName":"The New American Video","channelLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ0kmBes7vSjT3QoWDfjwwg","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T29sE1NM6oE","description":"The Evans family just secured a major win for parental rights in Idaho, with the state Supreme Court ruling that a law purporting to require grandparent visitation is unconstitutional.

During the siege of Mariupol, he was captured and sentenced to death in a show trial by the Supreme Court of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), but was freed in September in a prisoner exchange.\n\nHis service in the Ukrainian marines makes him an active-duty soldier protected by the Geneva conventions on prisoners of war. However, Russian state media has portrayed him as a mercenary. Another British citizen, Aiden Aslin and the Moroccan Saadoun Brahim, received identical verdicts in the same trial.[4] British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss tweeted that: \"The judgement against them is an egregious breach of the Geneva convention.\" The defence attorney did not even ask for an explanation as to why the existing arguments against mercenary status were not been taken into consideration, simply saying instead that \"the guilt of my client has been fully established\".\n\nSupport Channel
