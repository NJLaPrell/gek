description: "Gek is an application for sorting YouTube videos into user defined categories based on rules. The sort regularly runs for the user's subscribed channels and sorts new videos based on the rules. The application is built on NodeJS, using express as the backend. Firebase is used for storage, the YouTube Google API for accessing YouTube, and Google's OAuth2 for handling user authentication. The backend is located in /server and is written in typescript which is converted to javascript when deployed. The frontend uses angular 14."
